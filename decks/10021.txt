Deck Name: Brujah Barons Steal the Truth
Description:
Created this deck one hour before the start of the tournament. Wanted to play something new,
and did not care much about winning chances being extremely tired and the tournament organisor.
I like to adopt decks or deck concepts, and am a big fan of the TWDA and tools like the VDB.
My deck's inspiration is "Stolen Truth" by Jay Kristoff, thus the name.
The Brujah version became possible with the release of the new 5th Edition decks.

Finals seating: Nikica (Malgorzata + Lord Tremere Toolbox) => Jay (Hesha Ruhadze [G6] Bleed) =>
me (Brujah Undue Influence) => Sebastian (Anson + Masika Toolbox) => Kevin (Barons Toolbox)
