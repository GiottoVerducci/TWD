Deck Name: Dumpster Fire of Pure Hate
Description:

I have virtually constructed an Emerald Legionnaire (EL) deck for every clan, plus Imbued; this is the Imbued deck.
I made a few last-minute tweaks before entering the AC, one of which was Nightmares upon Nightmares -
that was a real brain-fart and it does not belong in this deck.

The general idea here is to stay alive with Liquidations and defend with Imbued
until you can amass an army of ELs to bleed with.
If I am concerned about my Harbinger getting rushed before recruiting a Legionnaire,
I will bring out Imbued first (or simultaneously if multirush is imminent) to block for her.
Then I have to keep the EL alive and unstolen until his special can pull more out from my ash heap;
after that, the deck can start to move.

As a hater of the Imbued, I see this deck as representing many of the worst aspects of the game,
hence the title. Other unlikeable facets include Veil of Darkness (hardest card-text in the game to abide by),
Liquidation, Unmasking, and of course, Emerald Legionnaire.
If the mechanics of Ashur Tablet weren't antithetical to the workings of this deck,
I would have searched for a way to include them as well. Lupine Assault was in my pre-tweaked version,
just for the extra table hate.
If you try playing this, you might switch out Nightmares upon Nightmares for Lupine, or maybe for a third Veil.
