-- 1GW4.5 + 3VP in final

Second tournament in a row that I deposit my win in the final table position pick.

I qualified first for the final, followed by Humberto, Gabriel, Rodrigo and Tárcio.

Because I was the last to choose the position at the table, I saw an advantage in attacking Humberto's MONODEM deck, and for playing with a FULLRUSH deck, I was being preyed on by Tárcio with his TZI BLOCK. And that choice made all the difference.

Final Table:

Rodrigo Roselli (Sebastien Goulet Satyrs/Spirals) ->
(2vp) Tárcio Martins (Tzimisce G4/5 Block) ->
(3vp/Gw) Tiago Ramos (Mambo Jeanne Multirush) ->
Humberto Aguiar (Malk Ks Monodem) ->
Gabriel Waichert (Matasuntha/Inyanga Block)

Deck Name : MAMBO No. FIVE!!
Description : Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Number Five!!!
