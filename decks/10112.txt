-- 2GW6 + 4vp in final

Deck Name: Shilmulo Death Star
Description: A Ravnos Death Star deck. A reworking of my other Death Star designs.  Based on Matt Morgan's original design.

Brad mid-cap DEM 1vp ->
Jesse died too fast for me to recall ->
Me 4vp ->
Guy Platinum bleed ->
Darby Imbued Chainsaw

Brad came out of the gate firing on all cylinders.  He didn't have a bleed for less than 4
against his first prey.

I was struggling to do anything useful with my opening hand, which contained a bunch of
stealth and Shilmulo Tarot.  I brought up Paul Forrest first and equipped the Tarot.
These extra draws came in very handy as I wasn't getting much card cycling other than my
discard.

Guy was also starting very fast.  Each Platinum bleed hit and by the time Guy was ousted
there were 8 or 9 corruption counters on Darby's Imbued.  Darby was under immediate and
constant pressure.

I did manage to draw into my Con Boons in a timely fashion and was keeping my pool total
high in anticipation of Brad's big bleeds.  Once he was my predator, I decided to No-Block
every action.  His first turn as my predator was still very damaging, but he only had two
vampires at that point.  I was running with Paul, Chavi, Irena, and a baby.  Guy takes
some bleeds of one, but reduces all the bleeds of two.

On my next turn, I'm low on pool and I play a master card to draw the Revolutionary
Council from my Tarot, attempting to oust Guy with votes, since his bleed reduction was
too consistent.  The vote gets DI2'd, so I have to bleed instead.  Guy has 6 pool and Paul
Forrest plus the hand and Tarot stealth make short work of him as he was out of bleed
reduction.  Darby was at three pool and I had saved Chavi for last, setting up many
different stealth cards in hand to combine with her special.  I go for the bleed of three
and manage to hit 4 stealth, just enough to make it land.

Twelve pool to the better, but it's Brad's turn and he removes almost all of those gains.
I make a baby and call Exclusion Principle.  Fire off a few bleeds all boosted by Paul
Forrest who can get The Coven blood every turn during the heads-up.  Brad's pool total is
still very high because Darby was unable to make any forward progress.  Another round of
bleeds.  I Archon the plus-bleeder and Brad's remaining vampires do very little.  I recur
Eat the Rich because Gem Ghastly is a Primogen, then proceed to vote and bleed Brad off
the table.

This deck originally had Rom Gypsy, which was removed.  I never bothered to put City Star
Taxi back in, but an additional stealth permanent might prove useful in some metas.
