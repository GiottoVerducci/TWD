-- 2GW7.5 + 3vp in final

Deck Name: Take cover Mr Emerald
Description :
The list is quite classic I think, there are few things to comment on. I planned to get more assaulted on my first Emerald, hence the DIs, the light cept mod and the prevent for my vampires to survive (I was expecting a very combat meta). I preferred rollings and combat ends because I was expecting a very gun/marduk meta. The deck had a grinder module like the one made by Mounisch, but I preferred to remove it to increase stealth, prevent and cept. Overall, I had good outings on all my games, especially on placements that put me away from boring stuff (except table one). In the final I think I place myself at best, far from the gangrel who cept / fight and in front of the AAA who pool like a savage. In my starting hand I have unmasking + giant blood, which counterbalances the rest (aura readings, 2 targets, a spiritual intervention and a rolling).

Thank you again very much for the weekend, the top organization and the kindness of the players. I had a really good first IRL tournament, and I can't wait to do it again soon (but after a break anyway :p)
