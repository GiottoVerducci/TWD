-- 3vp in final

Deck Name: The Might of Ur-Shulgi, The Shepherd
Description:
Basically this is a toolbox bleed with stealth deck focused on the power of Ur-Shulgi. Using Murmur (redirect or bleed) with Blood Awakening (block fails or intercept) and some shenanigans like Spying Mission (stealth, anti redirections or extra bleed with the 5 caps), I managed to honor our mighty Assamite clan with a glorious victory crushing the filthy Ventrue on a very tight finals (with some off the books helps from the Ministry). Holding Khabar: Glory for the right time for that extra 4 pool is crucial. Also Black Sunrise or Mylan with Enkil Cog is really interesting.

After the tourrnament, I noticed using Monastery Of Shadows was a mistake, it should be exchanged with another Dreams. Rutor's Hand underperformed and should get out so you can use an Aranthebes or an extra govern. The Coven could be used instead of Perfectionist.
