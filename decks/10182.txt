-- 1GW4 + 1.5 in final

Sunny day at the venue, Hyvikää Villatehdas, opened up with a nice surprise of 25 participants and even some friends from Sweden and Belgium. Games were tight and bloody, but the atmosphere was fantastic.

Big thanks to everyone who participated and also to Hypecon staff for hosting us and being very helpful with everything!

Finals Seating:
Magnus Söder (Ravnos Week of Nightmares) --> Tommi Hakomaa (Jost/Rebekka) --> Aapo Järvelin (The Capuchin Wall) --> Bram Van Stappen (Matasuntha & Company Wall) --> Noora Hirvonen (Girls will find Inner Circles)

Deck Name: Girls will find... Inner Circles
Description:
Mostly after Jorge Delgado's EC2019 Day 1 winning deck - added Archon Investigation, some differentiating stealth, swapped Lucian to Mistress Fanchon, and totally forgot to put in Information Highway (which would have been very nice).
