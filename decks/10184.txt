-- 1.5vp in final

Deck Name: Anson Gunz post-Parity Shift nerf
Comments: Changed slightly the deck after 2019. Upgraded to 12 Ashurs to try and dispute the Ashur race to Girls decks mainly. Switched the 2 Parity Shifts by 2 Anathema. Also removed Pentex Subversion for obvious reasons (I was using it maybe for the "can't act" part against vampires with Secure Haven or vampires I could not deal with).

My thoughts is that regarding the amounts of barons in tables, it is impossible to reasonably play votes with this decks. So all the votes are going out, the only x-table capacity of this deck remaining the rushes. I will add some Conditionings most likely since the ousting power of this deck is extremely limited. I will also downgrade again to 9x Ashurs since 12x seems a little bit overkill after testing. Also adding Secure Haven for contest.
