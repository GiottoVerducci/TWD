-- 2GW6 (3rd seed) + 4VP in final

Deck Name: ABC-EL Daughters: A Chorus of Legionnaires
AKA: Pentex Is Still Good
Description: Shattering Crescendo + Emerald Legionnaire

This deck mainly does three things:
1. Get Legionnaires, 2. Shattering Crescendo, 3. Bounce bleeds.
It includes obfuscate stealth, a sturdy bounce package, a couple flavorful masters and a solid crypt of vamps with some very useful special abilities, all of which were utilized to good effect during this tournament.

Thanks to Darby Keeney and Karl Schaefer for tweak suggestions that made a meaningful difference.

Agent of Power was a game winner in my first round; being able to pull off one last Shattering Crescendo with Colette came in very handy. Pentex Subversion sealed the deal in the finals, once I was heads-up with Kelly's Lazverinus block deck.

These were the decks of the finalists:
* Kelly Schultz: Lazverinus blocker
* Mariya Hyryk: Kiasyd bleeder
* Bill Troxel: Legionnaire trash fire
* Norm Brown: Gangrel barons
* Adam Hulse: Toreador Daring the Dawn bleeder
