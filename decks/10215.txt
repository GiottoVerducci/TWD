Deck Name: Dmitra Calls the Shots
Description: A modified version of Martin Major Dmitra assualt rife deck to adjust for the meta (Closed Session, Ancilla Empowerment) and the fact that parity shift doesn't give as much pool now.
I would say Ivory bow is missing and Carlton (but don't need Carlton if you switch to AK-47 - but then need to switch Side strike))
