-- 1GW5.5 + 0.5 in final

Once again, the basement of Fantasiapelit was packed with VTES players, as to everyones surprise 20 blood thristy bleeders decided to join us, instead of going to Ilosaarirock music festival!

This time the games were extremely cautious, with a lot of very resilient and blocky decks, and scary combat. Out of the 12 games, only 7 game wins were scored, with no game wins on the first round of the tournament!

After the dust settled, the winner was clear. The feared Toni Karjalainen with his strong Banu Haqim deck came back from his long hiatus to teach us mortals how the game is played.

Thank you to every one who attended. This must have been one of the most memorable and fun tournaments I have organized!

Finals Seating:
Toni Karjalainen (Banu Haqim) --> Antti Penttilä (Khursid Block & Legionnaires) ---> Noora Hirvonen (Nana Buruku Animalism) --> Pasi Karjalainen (Gangrel Wall) --> Aapo Järvelin (Anneke Wall)
