Deck Name: Baalicious Barons

4VP in the final. Mutes + Arishat + Barons for vote lock and attrition.

Fairly light stealth. Added 2x Organised Resistance and 2x Monkey Wrench
for a bit more flexibility. 6x Bait and Switch likely better than
Organised Resistance however prey jamming on bounces works.

Xeper for anti ally / legionaries. Museum for Recursion.

Thanks to Karl Schaefer for convincing me on the power of Eat the Rich.
