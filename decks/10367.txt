After last year's dramatic surge in participation numbers, we managed to retain a similar level, despite a bunch of last minute cancelations. For myself, it was the fifth time hosting the nationals, so the routine is getting pretty well rehearsed. As seems to be a common theme in Finnish large events, we had a tight schedule dictated by the venue's limitations, but everything went well, as usual

The hit meme of the tournament was the amount of the unnamed decks. At least six of them were spotted, which means that almost every seventh deck featured our dear old shady beast. I was naturally a part of the problem myself, but I regret nothing, even though I may be personally partly to blame for the phenomenon. And even though there was another unnamed in two of my three tables...

The amount of combat decks seemed very low by Finnish standards, and I didn't come across that many walls, either. This was reflected in the final that included two heavy bleed decks, one bleed/vote, one bleed/breed, and one wall.

The final table:

Antti Penttilä (Palla Grande breed) 1 VP
Jyri Puhakka (the unnamed bleed)
Teemu Sainomaa (Gangrel barons wall) 3 VP
Juha Nyholm (Art of Memory bleed) 1 VP
Esa-Matti Smolander (Stanislava)
