Deck Name: Malkavian bleed with a twist of hand control
Author: Oortje
Description: Malkavian bleed with a twist of hand control.G56 TWD 17-04_23.
This is a bleed deck with a little fat, which makes it slower then a usual bleed deck. First bring out the biggest with DOM and play 3 or 4 governs superior. Once you have 3 vampires the deck slows down a little because it lost 3 or 4 governs and usually not a lot of stealth. So you should clog little on stealth. But this normalizes in the mid-late game. So poke and bleed a few 1 bleeds just to give m some fake hope.
Oh boy what a joy to play precision bleed. Revelations helped me to get at least 3 sure oust. it's hits were 3 bait and switches, 1 villein, some bleed reduce card and enough knowledge to know that bleeds of 6 would not get me burned.
About the hand control from the title: I not only like to control the hand of my opponent with revelations but also my hand. So I like to play my bleed decks with a big handsize, because I refuse to go into topdeck mode. Bittersweet,Mellon,dreams,library even hearth all support the sure play strategy. Count the number of times that you rely on cards that are in your deck instead of in your hand and if that happens once every 2 turns or more than you should reconsidder your handmanagement strategy.
