-- 2GW7 + 2.5 in final

Deck Name: Hell Rising (Homework 2021)
Description: unnamed + The Rising
WoN 2021 Homework Assignment: Darby Keeney, Kelly Schultz, and I discussed how to
make an unnamed plus The Rising module work. I played this last year at Origins and had
2GW, but a bad final. This year with a slightly tweaked deck, I managed 2GW in the
prelims and another in the finals.

Me: 2.5vp ->
Andrew: Tremere toolbox 0vp ->
Marshal: Valkyrie bleed 0vp ->
Darby: G6 Gangrel wall 0.5vp ->
Ben: my Angelique Shamblers + Legionnaire deck 0.5vp

My opening hand was strong: Enkil Cog, Thirst, The Rising, stealth, and Instantaneous. I
drew into Mylan, Homunculus, and Blithe Acceptance early. I managed to land my first
bleed and drop the Enkil Cog only to have Ben DI the Cog! With my own deck! Then, he
bled me with Trochomancy to remove the possibility that I would recur the Cog into hand
with Tablets. The game turn real slow for me as Ben managed to get some Shambling
Hordes and I had to fight with Tremere intercept to get even bleeds of one through (which
were almost always bounced).

No one drops a second event; The Rising is looking less good in my hand as time moves
on. I finally get the chance to drop it and another Cog shortly thereafter. After about 75
minutes of trying to cycle cards, we're back in "go" mode with a fully operational
unnamed. It takes a bit, but I get a lunge in at around 20 minutes left to get my prey. The
following turn, I get Marshal. I manage to pop the Tablets and recur my Pentex, Elder
Impersonation, Psychomachia, and stealth, taking the Pentex to hand. I was hoping to
bleed Darby on his turn after my next one, as I needed to filter out some useless cards.
We never got there unfortunately. TBH, the DI of the Cog probably gave me this game by
making it much slower for me. If I encounter Darby earlier, I probably run into problems
with the wall.

The Rising played a key role in the final as I prevented several Villeins from hitting the
table (including two from my prey; they were in hand when I ousted) and removed Darby's
pool gain engine.
