Deck Name: Burn down the patriarchy
Description: MMPA and revolts. The final round was very different to the preliminary ones, since the heaviest SB decks made it there with most of the vps along with my not that reactive girls. I chose the deck expecting toolboxyish meta, which was mostly right in the prelim. I managed to bloat through the heavy SB in the finals (regret for not including Archon investigation this time), and having enough rushes was key, even if I didn't drawn any acceleration and had to be very careful with my actions. My plan from the start was to go the salmon way, since I knew I could not leave my back open for any of the other decks in the table and my own prey was a lower seed if they happened to get 2 vps in the process (which is what happened, so I won draw with higher seed). I played most of the round with Nana and Aksinya, only getting Cybele up on the latter half of time limit, and risking being ousted by the malk94, but the +1 stealth bleeds of three with Monastery of shadows was the critical finishing touch in the end.
