Just a quick overview as I don't really have the time... feel free to contribute in the thread! An amazing FORTY-NINE Methuselahs assembled in Brussels to compete in the largest Belgian event in my memory. Players came from all over Europe, from Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, Czechia, Austria, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, UK, Denmark and Finland!

The Outpost shop gave us the usual great setting, basically reserving the whole space for us. Kudos to them!

The finals' seating was as follows:
Javier (G2-3 merged Barons wall) -> Tero (Malgorzata) -> Bram (Omaya & co. wall) -> Héctor (Gangrel Barons Dual Form) -> Frédéric (Brujah Alastor).

The final was basically an exciting (er...) "High Noon" movie lasting 1 hour and 58 minutes, after which Bram managed to oust Héctor with a combination of Tero's deflected bleeds, Frédéric's backward Disarms, and all-powerful bleeds for one.

Result: Bram 1.5vp, Tero, Javier and Frédéric 0.5vp, Héctor 0vp

Many congratulations to the one and only Belgian Constructed, Limited AND now Grand Prix Champion, Bram the unparalleled!!! And many thanks to all the players for making it such a great event!
