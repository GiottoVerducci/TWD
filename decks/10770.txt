Deck Name: Windham's Wind Dance
Description: A tremere war chantry deck. Wind Dance was added to counter Hunger of Marduk. I didn't encounter any Banu Haqim decks though. But Wind Dance was also effective against aggravated pokes and other nasty surprises in combat. 90 card deck size causes lot of variance and I was in trouble with my draws couple of times. 77-82 deck size would be better.
