-- 1GW3 + 4vp in final

With this fifth edition, the Tragic Love Affair series returned after a 1½ years break and now ties with my former Töölö Grand Ball concept for longevity. We had a lot of good games in a very varied meta.

The final table:

Lauri Salmi (Mambo Jeanne rush)
Jyri Puhakka (Brujah baron bleed & vote)
Tero Aalto (Stanislava) 1vp
Antti Penttilä (mostly Brujah baron bleed & vote)
Joona Tuominen (the unnamed bleed) 4vp


Deck Name: The Need For Bleed, starring The unnamed
Description: Heavily inspired by Tero Aalto:s version of The unnamed with my own little twists to it, deck is fun to play but will get table hate all the time
Will type up something about the tournament when i get the time
