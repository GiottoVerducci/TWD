Deck Name: Gang of fur
Description:
Based on multiple iterations of Stanislava decks, nothing original. Credit goes to Martin Weinmayer who served as inspiration for this deck.
Pretty happy with the deck overall would maybe try and find place for 1 more Hartmut Stover and remove 1 Parity Shift for 1 Banishment.

So why this unoriginal deck? In the last months we have had big discussions in our parisian playgroup about the ongoing debate about Ashur Tablets, MMPA and Emerald Legionnaires being too powerful. I have always stated that I am against the nerfs because other decks make better or equal results in the current meta (maybe EL needs to be reviewed with caution, definately not AT or MMPA in my opinion, still against a nerf on EL).

I set myself the challenge to try and play less AT and play other decks that I think are strong or I simply like. The result has been 5 finals in the last year with decks without AT (Weenie AUS, Shambling, Khazar, Carna and Stanislava) and 2 tournament wins (Carna & Stanislava). I have to say that it feels much more powerful to play Stanislava than to play Girls in most of the tables and I generally have better results playing without than with AT.

During this tournament I did the following results: 0vp in the first table (Axel was playing a Ministry S&B with tons of pool gain, I was bleeding all the time and got him down to 5 pool during the duel); 5vp in the second table; 4vp in the third table (4-player table). Total of 2GW 9vp in the preliminary rounds with 2 4-player tables.

The seating in the finals was: Axel (Ministry S&B pool gain) > Vincent (Maila Tap&Bleed) > Guilhem (Edward Vignes & friends) > David (Banu Haqim Bruise&Bleed). I took the bold decision to sit behind Axel, although I didn't manage to oust him during the first round. My idea was to convince the Banu to let me put pressure on Axel (and do nothing behind, not even bounce his bleeds), so that he had a chance to oust me but avoid Axel winning the finals. Axel and David were ousted, then I gave a chance to Vincent to get his VP and when I saw that it was complicated and I was risking getting ousted myself I lunged for the 2 remaining VPs. So the end result was 4vp in the finals.

Stanislava is definately strong.
