We had nice and cosy preliminary rounds - mostly finishing in time outs. Only Otso was so greed that he swept two out of three rounds. Also the finals timed out, so 2GW from 7 tables...

Final round was:

Otso (Ministry vote)
Lasse (Nadima&Mirembe vipers&temptation)
Pasi (Anarch/Barons toolbox, see below)
Mikko (Banu Haqims)
Antti (Legionnairs with Matasuntha [no show in the finals])

Very short description of the finals is, that I (Lasse) had an awful crypt draw and wasn´able to defend myself. Main fight was between Antti and Otso, while Pasi was waiting for the right moment (and did not have any pressure) and Mikko was balancing whether to go forward and take a VP from Antti or to let Legionnairs weaken Otso. In the end (and it really was close) ousts for Otso (1vp), Antti (1.5vp) and Pasi (1.5vp), and Pasi won the tournament with higher rank.

This was first tournament for Mikko and he was close to win the finals (so was Antti and Otso). Also first tournament (and first games) for another 13 year old player, who happens to have same address as me...
