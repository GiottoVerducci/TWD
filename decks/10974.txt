-- Thank you to all the participants for joining the tournament. The final was very combat heavy with 3 very violent decks, accompanied by 2 bleed decks.
-- The final seating was as follows:
-- Joona Tuominen (unnamed)
-- Niko Vanhatalo (Finnish Politics Potence weenies)
-- Teemu Pulkkinen (Black Hand bleed)
-- Antti Penttil√§ (Massassi combat)
-- Jani Malmi (Banu Haqim combat + vote)
-- Joona was ousted quite fast and I (Teemu) was ousted soon after. Niko and Jani made a deal to oust Antti to try to resolve the game in a 1v1 situation, and in the end it was Niko who came on top with 4vp and a GW.
-- Congratulations to Niko for the win. You can see the winning decklist at the beginning of this post.
