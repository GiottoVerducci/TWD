-- 3vp in final

Deck Name: “Do nothing til you win”
Author: Richard Stefan Utner
Description: Kudos to Richard for the deck design. Easy to play and very forgiving. Both Elder Library and Visit from the Capuchin are the obvious must have. I just recently opened miscutted V5 PCDs and wasn't able to add those in for legal play. Giants Blood, Direct Intervention and Heart were MVPs.
