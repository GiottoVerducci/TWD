-- GW3 + GW2.5 + 2vp / 2.5 in final

Deck Name: Piper Legionnaires
Description: Antti's deck with cosmetic modifcations. The deck works like a charm, it's crystal clear that Antti considered the decklist really well. After Day 1 at the EC I took out one bleed redirection plus some other less important cards and replaced them with prevents as I've heard some rumors about the local meta

What never worked: 2x Vengeful Spirit. Also, I finished each game with my vampires empty or in torpor. The original decklist had Soul Feasting in it - I don't have them so I put in Giant's Blood instead, but I'm not sure if I would have changed this even if I had them. I would probably put in one for Anu, probably works really well. I'm also considering The Rack. The original decklist also had Guardian Vigils in it - I prefer Eagle's Sights, they're easy to get rid of if needed, and they won me 2 games.
