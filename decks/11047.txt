Deck Name: Unforgiven Stanislava
Description: The deck was inspired by Le Sserafim's song, Unforgiven. It was designed to pull off big bleeds and impactful referendums unapologetically. Throwing in MMPA was icing on the cake since I felt that I would garner table hate anyway. The day would be kind to me as I was able to time my big bleeds (8 to 10) when my prey doesn't have any access to bounce. A few things to note is that the Philippines has a very combat heavy meta with a lot of grapples to deal with so I had to throw in some Rolling with the Punches in favor of 2 copies of Earth Meld and a copy of Form of Mist. The deck earned me 2GW7 in the Preliminary Rounds, 4vp and the win in the Finals.
