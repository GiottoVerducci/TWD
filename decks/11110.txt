- 1.5vp in final

Deck Name: Royal with Cheese
Description: This is a new version of the deck. The deck was pretty slow so I've added a lot of Zillah's Valley and Aksinya Daclau (who happens to have all the right disciplines but no title, hence the Regent). The conclusion is that even when you pack 11 Zillah's, you won't draw more than one in the early game! But it's probably bad luck.
