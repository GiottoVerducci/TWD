-- 1GW4 + 2,5vp in the final

Deck Name: Gangrel Grinder
Description:
I was missing 2 cards to play the same list Otso won ropecon, so I made the following changes:

-1 Organized Resistance
-1 Claws of the Dead
+1 Eyes of the Wild
+1 Canine Horde

Props to Otso, fun deck, Hell-for-Leather and Walking Stick were great cards for surprising opponents.

If I had the cards, I would revert the changes. Canine horde wasn't useful at all, and I wish I could have another aggravated strike instead of it.
