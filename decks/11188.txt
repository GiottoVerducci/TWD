-- 1GW3 + 1.5vp in final

Having moved back to Helsinki at the end of last year, the TLA tournaments also got a new location in our new residence's club room. The facility received a lot of praise for its location and spaciousness, and I'll definitely organize more of the same in the future.

Everybody I talked to had expected the meta to consist largely of new decks, but instead, not much had changed. I personally experienced a table with five vote decks, which was sort of refreshing and sort of not.

The final table:
- Teemu Sainomaa (Chameleon Barons) 1,5
> Aki Puolakka (Salubri V5)
> Otso Saariluoma (Gehenna Barons) 1,5
> Julius Kaplas (DEM bleed)
> Tommi Hakomaa (Tzimisce G2 wall) 0,5

Deck Name: Carthage Withering
Author: Otso Saariluoma
Description: My take on Nina's barons with Slow Withering. If the draw and the table work out, it should be able to build to an overwhelming position in the late game. It's also rather hard to interact with the build-up as it's mostly masters, transfers, events and concealed magnums. However, the list felt clunky as it is and a handsize of six hurts.

After the tournament, would cut Flames of Insurrection (felt like a win more card), Smiling Jack and Constant Revolution (low impact during the day), as well as one of each of Organized Resistance, Diversion and Dust Up (just to smoothe out the draws). Might double up on New Carthage.
