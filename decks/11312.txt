Deck Name: If You Live Long Enough...
Description:
sometimes you get lucky.  Today was definitely that day.  I have played Carna before and
had much better preliminary rounds, but today it was just about surviving.

Special thanks to Mark Loughman, whose Teenage Witch and Traditional Princess served
as a basis for this.  He also kindly provided feedback on early versions of this deck.

Post V5C this deck seems to have more trouble.  More clans with easy unlocks, more
bounce. Lots of fast, fast bleed.  Round 1 featured five bounces and two DIs on a single
action. The next bleed saw four bounces.  Round two and the final had many similar multi-bounce actions.  Almost every time my prey was locked he had the right answer for any
bleed that I did.
