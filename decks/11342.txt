Deck Name: Nocturn Lasombra Bleed
Author: David Leite (this version at last)
Description: a Classic Lasombra bleed deck with nocturn with some bounce to capitalize on heavy ministry environment, the Nocturns are there to protect from rush or extra bleed as usual, the Zaire River Ferry and Unmasking only must be played if really needed, the solitary Delaying tactics are there just in case, the tournament was heavy on bleed and light on politics
