I'm pleased to report on the first tournament I organized. This was a trial to integrate tournaments into our regular weekly games, which usually attract enough people to fill multiple tables. The initial test was a success, drawing 10 players to the event. The intense bleeds and strategic rushes to key targets ensured the preliminary rounds concluded way ahead of time. A big thank you to all who joined us for the thrilling late-night games! Special appreciation goes to Teemu for brainstorming weekday tournament ideas with me and to Tero for sharing valuable archon tips that helped keep everything running smoothly.

The final round featured the following decks: Bram (Tremere Embrace swarm bleed) -> Matias (Lasombra S/B) -> Teemu (Anarch Banu rush) -> Niko (Mono Potence) -> Marko (Lucian bleed)

Niko and Matias each secured one oust, while Bram outplayed the competition, securing the rest of the points and winning the final with 3vp. Congratulations to the winner!
