Deck Name: Fire in the Belly Encore (Magic in the Valley)
Description:
It was the week before the tournament when Mikey Ferguson messaged me about my Fire in the Belly deck that helped me win the February Tournament in the Philippines. Incidentally, I have been making tweaks to it so the discussion about the deck was most welcome. The most important change is adding a Magic of the Smith Toolbox in order to fetch an early Heart of Nizchetus to improve consistency and also to fetch relevant pieces of equipment later on in the game.

And thus, Fire in the Belly Encore (Magic in the Valley) was born. It was only fitting to bring out this deck that weekend as the it was certain that Le Sserafim would be performing Fire in the Belly at Coachella that day. So I decided to bring my own magic to the (Zillah's) valley and burn the stage so to speak.

The deck worked a lot smoother than before with Graverobbing doing a lot of work during this month's tournament. I even ended one game with one vampire from 3 out of the 4 other methuselahs.

The Auspex Package allowed me to play the role of table police for most games. Preventing ousts and disabling threats. This primed tables for big lunges earning me 3vp and 5VP from the two preliminary rounds respectively.

This allowed me to seat myself away from potential blockers in the final with Malgorzata doing heavy work allowing me to bloat and establish a strong board early on. This snowballed into a 4VP win for me in the finals with only Cien (Harmut Stover Stealth Bleed) being able to score a VP for ousting my then predator.
