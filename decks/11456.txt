First tournament of the year in Joensuu. Not that much politics around this time, but even more violence! I feel like combat was the most represented archetype in the tournament, most tables having at least two combat decks.

Finals game was a close one. Mari took first 2vp in quick succession, but having lost most of her minions and momentum to the combat decks she was bleeding, there was an opportunity for Simo to strike! Well timed Constant Revolution and defensive play ousted Mari, and in the 1v1 all Simo had to do was to pass the turn, to win the tournament with higher seed.

Finals Seating:
Lasse Pöyry (Hatch the Viper & Trophies Combat/Wall) --> Simo Tiippana (Protean Baron Breed) --> Aapo Järvelin (Cailean Wall/Combat) --> Mari Tiippana (Dementation Bleed) --> Antti Penttilä (Tupdog Combat)
