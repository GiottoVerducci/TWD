Deck Name: Vozhd on a Hawg
Created by: Jan-Willem Kaagman 
Description:  The deck is based on the standard 2024 Tzimisce deck. I didn't understand why the "Childe of the revolution" was in the standard V5 deck, so I took them out. The goal was to get either a Vozhd or a War ghoul on a Hawg. 
Unexpected key card: Owl Companions, with which I was able to guess if I could safely block actions and either avoid getting aggrevated damage (Form of Mist) or dealing aggravated (Sculpt the Flesh)
