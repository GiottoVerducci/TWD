Deck Name: Bestiary of a sober haunting
Description: Based on Alessandro Donati's TWD The Ultimate Meat Experience! from 2024. I decided to change a few ratios and add some cards that might be useful, especially Aranthebes and the Library Hunting Ground were nice additions. The underbridge strays also proved useful, although they can be removed.  I would remove the graverobbing since it's too opportunistic and readding Montreal for the pool gain. But the deck proved very consistent and reliable in a quite bleed heavy meta.
