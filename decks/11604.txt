Deck Name: Mambo No. 1
Author:  ZaraZ
Description: A fine-tuned iteration of the Samedi g5/6 combat deck. It turned out that I made the right call going with Soaks instead of other damage-prevention cards for this tournament,  which gave me an advantage against the potence rush, war ghouls and some gunslingers I encountered. Dust to Dust is pure gold, so thanks go to ToY! for showing me how good this card is in this type of deck. Currently my favourite combat deck in the game
