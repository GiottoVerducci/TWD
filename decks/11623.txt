-- ORGANIZER REPORT
-- This tournament was special for me. It is my seventh year as the prince of Grande Vitória - which includes 5 nearby cities: Vitória (capital), Vila Velha (city where 90% of the playgroup lives), Cariacica, Serra and Viana.
-- This year, the idea came up of bringing newcomers to the game in a specific store where they played other cardgames. So Vinícius Costalonga became the prince of Vila Velha (since I am the prince of the capital, Vitória).
-- With that, we had a new playgroup, with new players coming from other games, and we have our traditional group, which has been together for 30 years, that's right, the same amount of time that VTES has been alive.
-- In this tournament, we had something special: Heitor, 13, son of Gabriel Waichert, a lifelong friend, making it to the finals. And also our second prince in history, Ed, making it to the finals. Opposites in age but with the same passion. I looked at Heitor and saw experience and mischief in a young boy, just as I looked at Ed and saw the sparkle in a young boy's eyes in a guy who taught 90% of us how to play.
-- I won't go on, because below is Ed's own report, but I'll just say that I couldn't be happier to have this family together every Saturday to play VTES.
-- VTES IS JUST AN EXCUSE!!! FRIENDSHIP IS WHAT REALLY COUNTS!!!
-- WINNER REPORT - ED PERSANTJ
-- Capixaba Vtes Championship - Report
-- Just a brief report about an incredible day of games, fun and bleeds.
-- Table 1
-- Me (Tupdog) > Baali Unnamed > Equipment Hesha > Weenie votes > Toreador V5 Vote
-- My first hand came out excellent, without me knowing: Wider View; Yawp Court; Rock Cat. I raised Tupdog, put down YC and didn't even know that my predator was a vote. But, Hesha started his equipping combo and the table went on alert. On my predator's turn, he played a Protected Resources and saved the table. The game went on with the Tupdogs visiting the Unnamed and the Toreadores and Hesha unable to perform his infinite bleed. When I managed to make my VP, I went after Hesha, but the Toreadores recovered. I had 9 minions and ended up taking an Anarchist Uprising that took me out of the game.
-- Result: GW Toreador, 1 VP Tupdogs.
-- Table 2
-- The Horde with Maleficia and Gehennas > Me Tupdogs > Ministry B&S > Malk! Block
-- The toughest table of the tournament. I knew that Ministry would be fast and that my Horde predator couldn't grow. So, I got the worst, or best, of the day. I crossed the table, after an Eagle's Sight. I had to have freedom of action, I couldn't have another wall on the table and a card in my deck would get rid of the Gehennas, but I had to rotate my hand. Ministry made VP. I managed to restructure myself. I took out Ministry and went to GW. There was a Smiling Jack growing on the table and that was the first mission. I took out SJ when I was at 6 and noticed that Horde could be without any of the 40 scobax in hand. Three vampires in torpor and one burned later, GW came. Tense, studied and beautiful table. A battle where no one could miss.
-- Table 3
-- Toreador V5 vote (another) > Me Tupdog > Banu Haqim (Rush&Bleed) > Equipment Hesha
-- Quick table. My predator also had Protected Resources in the deck. But it came in the bounce rebuy, which was canceled by Hesha. I didn't have enough minions to take down Hesha's defenses, before taking his 3 million bleed. GW Hesha.
-- Final
-- Lasombra (Vote&Bleed) > Toreador V5 (from the 1st table) > Ministry B&S > Ahkunanse Grinder&Bleed > Me Tupdog
-- First of all, in the final there were 4 old players and a 13-year-old boy, the son of another old player who was also in the tournament. And it was great to see our Vtes growing and renewing themselves with the new generation.
-- Right at the beginning, I raised 2 Rock Cats and made 14 pool with the Autarckis Persecution. But the little Lasombra raised a vampire that was immune to damage from allies. Smart kid.
-- The Toreador kept fighting for votes with the Lasombras and Ministrys who had titles. Ahrimane had only 1 vampire and was ready to raise those of the 8nvolado at the right time. And everyone watched the little Lasombra fight bravely with the Tupdogs.
-- Now, I can confess. My strategy was to show strength, but to take out the little Lasombra as late as possible, because I believed that, that way, I could control the time and the table. I was wrong.
-- The little Lasombra fell, honorably, with 15 minutes left. Ahrimane raised everyone and came at me, but he couldn't take me out and fell to the Ministry. The title was getting far away.
-- That's when the Toreador went for it to take out the Ministry and me. Once again, I had nine minions. In a battle of votes, I took another Anarchist Uprising. But this time, I had the pool to survive and managed, in the last minute of the championship, to take out the Toreador and win the VP title. Sweet revenge. Great game. Beautiful final.
-- Congratulations to Prince Tiago Honorato for organizing a great championship. And congratulations to all the participants for a day of great fun.
