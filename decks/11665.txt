-- 2GW7.5 + 0.5 in final

Deck Name: Radical Leftist
Description: Considering that this team of small incompetent Stanislavas is my freshest new TWD entry since the first unnamed win back in 2019, it was beyond high time to turn a new page. The deck is atypical to me in several ways, including not having a star vampire, nor any 10/11-caps. Then again, there are familiar traits, too, such as great combat defense and lunge potential. 5/5 would play again.
