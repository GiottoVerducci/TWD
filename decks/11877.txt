In a tense VTES match, the table featured Tzimisce allies (Mariana), Tupdog Nephandus (Márcio Pinheiro), Gangrel Torvus toolbox (Alexandre Costa), Nana Animalism combat (Riquinho), and Arika Obfuscate (William Feitosa). The Gangrel proposed, and the table agreed, to a deal to split against the Tupdog. However, Tupdog rushed and destroyed Arika early. Nana broke the pact, dropping two Anarch Revolts, crippling both Arika and Gangrel, and focusing solely on ousting Arika. With no chance of survival due to the Revolts, Gangrel self-ousted. Nana then engaged in a grueling uphill fight against Tupdog. Meanwhile, the Tzimisce grew stronger and capitalized on the chaos. The Tupdog player requested to gain pool with a autarkis persecutions to continue battling Nana, and the Tzimisce agreed. However, when D'arlette attempted to vote, the Tzimisce betrayed the deal and swiftly voted against. With Nana in shambles, the Tzimisce sealed their victory shortly after.
