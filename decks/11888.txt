-- Congrats to Marcus Jr for his win in this 19 person tournament with his G5/6 Ventrue. He came into the finals as last place seeding, but managed to not just outlast, but to 4VP GW vs. Darby, Mark, Soto, and Jason.
-- I am 99% positive Soto was playing Tupdogs/Nephandi combo, but was forced to focus a lot on his predator, Mark's Gargoyle vote deck. Meanwhile on the other side of the table, Darby was pounding Jason's Tzimisce with his G7 Ravnos deck; but not getting through, and causing Mark a lot of grief.
-- Marcus was not idle however, a potent combo of Sybren voting then unlocking and bleeding, mixed with Alexa's special allowing Marcus to pitch dominate cards for votes was Darby's undoing.
-- I'm sure there was a lot more detail to be shared on that table, hopefully some of the participants will swing by and discuss.
