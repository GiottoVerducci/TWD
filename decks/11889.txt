Deck Name: Great Beast Temp Agency: Los Angeles
Description:
This is a toolbox iteration of my rush-and-bloat-centric unnamed + Soul Gem + Call the Great Beast decks in which the Great Beast has superior Celerity, Protean and Temporis. The unnamed gets Abombwe for capacity, grabs the Soul Gem and then Calls the Great Beast. Lots of rushing ensues. The Great Beast uses Summon History to get Tye Cooper, who plays a critical role. Bloating is buffed handsomely by playing Golconda on the Great Beast before Calling a new one. What makes this build unique is its spread-out, toolboxy card diversity. It's quite fun to play, but if you want to try it, I recommend practicing in Lackey simulations before taking it to a table, as it can be complicated to pilot.
