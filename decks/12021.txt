Justin (Biggy) nearly took the Dragonfire last year, but this year he's powerful out the gate, taking our first tournament win with a strong vote/bleed deck based around the new Lasombra.
As prince, I was so happy to see the final table consisting of 5 fairly newish players who only began their competitive journey in Feb/March 2024 or later. Well done everybody!
It was very close in the heads up with Kris - who was first seed from winning the first two rounds, getting to choose his seat the most strategically, all the while Biggy was 5th seed - having no say in the final order of play.
The other finalists performed brilliantly in each round as well as in the final, but Biggy eventually came out on top when he found the block-deny to get past Kris's intercept wall-tower, Baron Dieudonne.
The older players need to adapt or die!
Well done Biggy!
