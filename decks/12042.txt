Deck Name: How Martin would play Arika
Author: Paul Direktor
Description:
This deck is strongly inspired by Martin Weinmayer’s latest TWD from the 28th of December 2024, 30th Stanislava. I adapted this horrendous master module to fit Arika.  Three direct interventions were maybe a bit excessive and I am unsure if the voter captivation is really necessary. The strong sides of this deck are its durability, especially in the early game. The key to this deck is to just wait and build your board, getting key actions through at the right time.

After 3 games, we had the following situation:

Arika (me) -> Malkav DEM bleed -> Kyasid Bleed -> Mambo Jeanne Rush -> Lasombra V5 bleed

As the top seed, I made the choice to sit as far away from Mambo Jeanne as possible. My game plan was to wait until the first oust happens and try to support my oust by deflecting bleeds from the Lasombra.
The Kyasid bleed deck died pretty quickly to the DEM bleed deck, when Mambo Jeanne started torporizing the DEM vampires. I managed to keep my prey low on pool, keeping him from running away with the table. My predator has been bleeding for one for most of the game, not drawing any bleed increase. Eating up most of the bleeds, liquidations and ashur kept my pool in order. Bringing out Queen Anne first (2nd spot), an early enkil cog proved very efficient in keeping up the pressure on my prey.

The key moment in the game happened after an hour: Mambo Jeanne was on 3 pool and lunging for the oust, but was one freak drive short of the VP and died one turn later. I decided to let my prey kill Mambo, since I thought that I have worse chances in a 1v1 against him. I quickly killed the DEM bleeder and my predator, the Lasombra bleed deck, was on 4 pool and low on blood. After one banishment and one bleed the game was done. 1GW 3VPs.
