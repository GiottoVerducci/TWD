Deck Name: I live in a museum
Description: Thank you Steffen as always for organising this fun 2 round + final tournament and everyone for such a nice day.

Designed this deck around Steely tenacity and it paid off.

The final was:
- Me starting player
- Steffen with Tzimi British museum bleed
- Roy Banu Haqim second tradition&retribution
- Jozef Tupdogs
- Ali Nakhthorheb

Initial talks against tupdogs stopped after Steffen left Roy at 4 pool.
Jozef rushed Steffen and Roy in the next turns never gave him the chance to recover.
An early bloodstone to Nakhthorheb gave me enough time to establish my position. Such an amazing, underrated card.

I ousted Steffen and survived ~4 rock cat and ~3 tupdog rushes. Roy torporised a bounced Nakhthorheb.

Table timed out.
