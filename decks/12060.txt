Deck Name: Don't Try This At Home, a.k.a. Enema Gathering
Description: This toolboxy Creeping Sabotage deck was made from two other decks smashed together, with some crypt changes afterward. One deck was an Anima Gathering + Organized Resistance + Earth Meld wall. The other was a Barons + Creeping Sabotage deck. The result is pretty weird. It features vamps with very different jobs, but somehow managed not to jam too badly and snuck in some GWs.

Constant Revolution got the boot in live-game tests because it typically helped my preys more than hindering them. I couldn't find a last-minute Baixinho, so I used Slag instead. Confiscation was freaking gold.
