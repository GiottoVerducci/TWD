-- 1GW5 + 2.5 in final

Deck Name: Ring that Bell v2.0

When Dafina was printed I knew that this crypt was solid.
Theo Bell, Dafina Hanganu, Nathaniel Bordruff and Fergus Alexander all have a built in rush.
Theo Bell, Dafina Hanganu, Nathaniel Bordruff and Fergus Alexander all have potence.
Theo Bell, Dafina Hanganu, and Nathaniel Bordruff have dominate.

I revamped my Theo Bell/Beast with Govern the Unaligned and splashed a few Titled Camarilla vote cards.

Deflection for defense is a lot better than having to rush backward.

In the finals I was preying on Sergio Martin who was playing Lucian the Perfect and was being preyed upon by Harp and his Gangrel. I rushed, disarmed and diablerized Lucian the perfect immediately.  Brad Cashdollar who was  playing .44 Barons ousted Harp.

This left a 3 way with Kelly Shultz being my prey and Brad Cashdollar being my predator.   Kelly was playing a Final NIghts deck that did a lot of blood damage to me, but Brad Cashdollar was able to ignore. Kelly Shultz within a few minutes of the game going to time, decided that he would self-oust.  The game then went to time and I won the tournament.
