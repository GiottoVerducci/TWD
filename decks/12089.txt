-- 1GW4 + 4vp in final

Deck Name: Alpha Beta
Description: [2024-06-11] V1.4 WON 24 Build.

Finally gave in, dropped the Zephyrs for Org Resist, dropped a Manifest for another bounce (probably good with non-ally bleedy meta) and with Saku's [for], swapped one Dust up for Diversion.  Otherwise unchanged despite hating the Thrown Gates most of the time.

Honestly, the Org Resists could be On the Qui Vive and it wouldn't make much difference, but whatever.

Kelly made changes including Torn Signpost, I immediately dropped them because they were getting drawn mid-round too often (TV more cyclable).  Also tried many more Org Resists, they also got in the way of combat when I needed it.
