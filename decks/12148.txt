Deck Name: My Version
Created by: Darby Keeney and Karl Schaefer
Description:
When you drink and contemplate what to do about the Sreelekha problem, wherein no
one really wants to decrypt her in the all-go version.  The answer is Anarch Convert.  After
more discussion it's 3 Anarch Converts.  Replace all but one duplicate, leaving Gathii.  His
special is the best and his ANI matters for Field Training.  Phaibun is the other option and
her dodge special might make her the meta-appropriate choice, but her PRE/OBF is less
useful in Field Training.  Leave one duplicate to prevent a 4-Anarch Convert decrypt.

Why is Convert better?  Round 2 Convert came out when I had 1 transfer, bled, paid for
itself with the Edge, bled every turn afterwards for 4 more pool total when Break the
Bonds had everyone locked, and finally stayed up to block a rush.  That's better than
Sreelekha could ever be.

The finals was a race with my predator, Darby, who was playing a Minstry bleed deck.  He
swept the round 1 table I was at where I got crushed by Fatima rush.  He was the higher
seed and decided to sit behind me.  I managed to stay ahead of him, in part, because he
could only afford two vampires.  My grand-predator had just enough Gangrel to keep the
pressure up, but zero Gangrel with ANI, so I didn't have to worry about rushes from Deep
Song.  Still taking bleeds of 5+ from both of Darby's vampires on most turns took its toll
and had me close to death on several occasions.  I did allow my vampires to be caught
quite a few times in the finals, where I depended on the S:CE from Memory Rift.  This
allowed me to lock vampires when I was having trouble getting the stealth ordering
correct because of how the cards drew.  I probably used that S:CE 4 or 5 times.  I made up
for these failed actions with greater numbers of vampires.  Game finished up with 4 cards
left in my hand and 4 pool left on the table.

Shout out to Andy  Smith and Kelly Lyons, whose versions of this were worked into and
out of this version over time.
