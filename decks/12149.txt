Deck Name: Compromise
Created by: Darby Keeney and Reagan Keeney
Description: Doberhuahuas fetch sticks and rampage.

A variant of this deck won a 9 player tournament a couple of years ago, after Reagan corrected a few imbalances. I continue to play the deck because it is too much fun to set aside. I'm giddy about getting its TWD entry in "Madison Mayhem - Tainted Springs"

Many of you won't get the concept for the deck - it relates back to a brilliant 2014 Audi commercial that can be found here:

Oh wow, that actually embedded!

I have created tracking proxies with screenshots from that commercial to handle the action modifier not attaching to the allies. I find they add to the play experience, and the first Tainted Doberhuahua should always be named "Franchesca Tiramisu."  Don't ask.

The "tech" is pretty straightforward.
-- Ludmilla amasses Doberhuahua for free and leverages [vic] stealth.
-- Rurik offers some bleed pressure, New Blood was supposed to be 2nd copy
-- Xipe tracks down Doberhuahuas that get inappropriately adopted

There's probably a viable version of using a couple more Villeins and the G6 Nos Primogen with bleed specials instead of the 3-4 caps with ANI.

From there abuse the puppies for rush, blocks, presses and unlocks to bounce as needed. Be creative. Jake Washington has torpored a full 5 cap blocker and lived to tell the tale... while attempting to bleed for 0. A Stray has held the Heart of Cheating and sacrificed himself mid-Entracement. The deck gets away with odd things.
