Starting off I am happy for all who managed to come.
We had 23 players in this event, 4 from Osjek, 4 From Austria.
This time we had no entry from Hungary.

In general the event was a lot of fun, as we did a good diversity of play-styles.

Rough breakdown of deck composition:
4 Brujah V5
3 Ravnos
2 Gangrela
2 Banu Hakim V5
1 Hecata
1 Harbingers of the skull
1 G4 Lasombra politics
1 Imbued
1 Bali / Great Beast
1 Laibon / Nana Buruku
1 Malkavian
1 Kiasyd
1 True Brujah
1 Saulot

Final Game: (Martin Weinmayer perspective)
The seating spelled doom, and the game began with a Fortschritt Library into an Unmasking of my Imbued prey. Fighting two intercepts would significantly slow me down, and I see no winning strategy going forward, just to be smashed into the waiting arms of the Brujah Combat deck should I succeed in ousting my prey. Instead, I play as much against my predator as possible, hoping to weaken the Gangrel Anarch so that the table has a chance later. Unfortunately, The Unnamed is unexpectedly caught by the blocking Brujah, sent to Topor, and diablerised by Milos Gangrel. His game essentially ended there. With an easy VP in his pocket, the Brujah went backwards on the Imbued, burning three of their minions. My efforts to keep the Gangrel under pressure paid off, and the Brujah Anarch lunge forward, eager to secure their second Victory Point. That was my time to act, and i oust the Imbued in their weakend state, keeping my pool out of Milos' ousting Range. I rescue Kuyen out of torpor in exchange for the contest yield on Heart of Nizchetus. Milos is forced to backoust Goran with a DI play on his last Organised Resistance, otherwise he would die to the Brujah next. Now in the heads-up against the Topseed Gangrel Anarch, I have the Pentex ready for Kuyen with Raven Spy, barely able to stealth past Milos' defense with three Earth Meld jamming his hand. It was an epic final, where I narrowly emerged victorious and Milos once again demonstrated his superiority as a Gangrel Anarch player.
