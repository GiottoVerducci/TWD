Final round report
Hecata > Brunhilde > Ravnos > Nosferatu > Gangrel Barons
The final was very close. Until the last moment, it wasn't clear who was going to win.
The Hecata deck quickly eliminated the Brunhilde and Valkyries deck.
At that point, the Nosferatu player had two options: the first was to eliminate their Ravnos predator, hoping their next predator — the Hecata player — would give them some peaceful turns so the Nosferatu could oust their prey, Gangrel Barons.
In the end, the Nosferatu chose not to eliminate the Ravnos, hoping the Hecata player would do it on their turn or at least weaken them significantly — which is exactly what happened.
The Gangrel deck had already taken a toll on the Hecata's pool, so they could no longer maintain as many Spectral Servitors and would lose offensive power.
Then the Nosferatu used a political action to oust the Ravnos player, allowing the Hecata to gain enough blood pool to survive — but not enough to be a serious bleed threat.
From that point on, the Nosferatu ousted the two remaining players in order and won the final.
