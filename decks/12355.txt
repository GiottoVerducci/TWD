-- 5vp in final

Deck Name: Antti Anarch auspex
Description:
Randal Rudstam sent me a cool gun deck a few years ago that I slightly tweaked and have had a lot of success with
Antti sent me this version of a Randal deck and I slightly tweaked it as well, but in both cases, the decks rocked as they were
Banshee Ironwail is great against all the soon to be seen allies, and Aura Reading saved me in the final because Norm Brown , the Avatar of Vtes combat , who was playing combat, was my prey, and Dean Garrison was my predator playing Tremere ranged aggravated damage
I was very careful to move forward or block, but when I had an aura reading, it paid off immensely
