Deck Name: (Very) Pretty Hate Machine
Description:
I have had a couple of versions of this deck.  The original version (Pretty Hate Machine)
was all 4/5 PRE vamps, but switching to all Toreador made the deck more powerful (better
Aire boost) and have more survivability.  I switched from 6/7 (all Toreador) to 5/6 (with one
!Toreador) because it provides better options for bouncing, even though it increases my
overall capacity somewhat.

The addition of the Heart of the City makes folks question whether letting a Public Trust
through is correct because the next one could be worse.

The deck usually plays very fast, but the finals was slow.  The first oust was 1:30 in.  I didn't
want to oust early because I would have had no answers for the endless rush of my
grandprey.  After the first oust by my grandpredator.  I got both my prey and grandprey in a
single turn with the help of a Pentex on Carlton.  In the heads-up, I had 21 pool and he had
9.   His two vampires with DOM (one being Stanislava) couldn't get me and I ousted him
next turn.

Thanks to Darby Keeney for feedback.
