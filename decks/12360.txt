Report by Skye Segal (Prince of Cape Town)

13 Players gathered, for warmth they say, on a Winter's Solstice Day in the Southern Hemisphere. And there were some toasty decks! But Claudi's Ravnos managed to collect the most GWs and VPs throughout and put her as 1st seed on the final table:

Final table was:

Justin (5th ed Lasombra vote bleed) 0 GW 2 VPs
Kris (!Salubru with bright flaming swords) 1 GW 4 VPs
James (5th ed Gangrel toolbox) 1 GW 3 VPs
Claudi (5th ed Ravnos SB & Do you like Dags?) 2 GW 7 VPs
Peter (Ahrimanes wall) 1 GW 6 VPs

Winner: Claudi Mailovich (#5000052) 2 GWs, 7 VPs, 4 final VPs (3 GWs 11 VPs total!)

Well done Claudi for taking no prisoners that Sunday!
