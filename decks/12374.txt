Deck Name: Arishat Barons
Description: Classic Arishat - Barons deck, nothing too tricky or unexpected.  Deliberately avoiding bleeding with this version to jam my prey on flick as best I can, previous versions have had 3 copies of Protected Resources but it's not always a good investment of 2 pool, two copies might be better though as I really wanted it out in a couple of games and didn't get it.
