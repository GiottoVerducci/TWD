Deck Name: Bram's Matasuntha Multirush
Author: Gotcha
Description: Once again, credit where credit is due. Bram, it's scary how well your decklists usually fit my playstyle. I made some marginal changes to the list I received from Bram. Some of them felt good (Beast Meld), while others were such that I would cut them if I were to play the deck again.
