-- 1GW4 + 4vp in final

Deck name:  Defy the Edict of Worms Revision 4.1

Probably my best assembled deck but it's losing value as political decks regain popularity and vampire capacities rise. On the plus side, Club Illusion is less dangerous to drop and I'm more likely to actually control Carfax Abbey and Anarch Railroad

The deck is still really fun to play and should improve with at least one NB vampire screaming to be included. Ironically, I was stuck with no-Baron C-team vampires in prelim games 2 and 3; inferior Protean is far less helpful, but I still managed a GW with a chump-only decrypt.

The library keeps self-bloating to above 82 cards. This iteration runs Form of the Cobra, which is shockingly good in discouraging block attempts and mitigates Aggressive Corpse rushes. Could probably lose one Form of Mist with these in place (or maybe 2 FotC, 4 FoM?). I pulled the EU-meta Blood Trade but didn't get the Uncoiling back in. It really needs to be in here with Hecata at seemingly every table.
