Corrupt Constructed
Warsaw, Poland

2R+F
20 players

As airline strikes in Finland forced us to extend our GP trip, we improvised an additional tournament for the extra day. Getting 20 players at less than 24 hours' notice was quite a surprise, but I'm not complaining. Big thanks to the local people for finding the venue!

The preliminary rounds were efficient and all ended with a GW. The final, however, was about to time out, until a predator-assisted oust followed by a Life Boon sealed the result at the literal last minute.

The final table:

Marko Saari (Małgorzata) 0,5
Nerijus Mikalajūnas (Huitzilopochtli) 0,5
Tommi Hakomaa (Gangrel Council) 1
Michael Holmström (Baron wall) 0,5
Tomasz Pietkiewicz (Black Hand bleed) 0

Congratulations to the winner and thank you to all participants!
