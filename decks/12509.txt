Deck Name: I'm your pusher

Description: "I'm your mama, I'm your daddy
I'm that museum in the alley
I'm your brother when you need
A true player card to retrieve
You know me, I'm your friend
Your main boy, thick and thin
- MC Garibaldi."

I would like to thank all who participated.
The seating in finales:
- First Milos Krstić: "I'm your pusher"
- Nikola Obradović: "DEMBleedz"
- Goran Ivanović: "Brujah barons"
- Srdjan Milojević: "Ministry plat-vote"
- Djordje Šutić: "Al-muntatir in time"
Let's start this year here, as a new tournament block is starting.
This time, we had a good portion of our local players out for the count due to "sports injury".
But we had a lot of fun.
For now, Groot is our main base of operations, and we hope to see more players next time around.
