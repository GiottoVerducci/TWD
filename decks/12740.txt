-- 1GW5 + 5vp in final

Deck Name: Malks 2010
Description: Has build this deck like 15 years ago, played once and put it on a shelf for a special occasion, as tournaments are rare in our climate and most players are casuals. When it was found that we will be getting anarch ravnos and gangrels on the field, piloted by experienced grognards, then I thought time has come to dig something degenerated from the past. With some luck and too greedy opponents I've managed to sweep one preliminary table, entered the finals being top seed, so it was quite an easy sweep there. 84-th card should be Touch of Clarity, moved it into other deck and forgot to return. After the event I think you need 3-4 Touches in this deck, maybe drop villeins and one Leverage for it (don't think more than 84 cards are needed). Has played Reality mirror once for just lolz (still went to torpor), played Coma once and it has moved me from 3 to 5 VP in the finals, haven't played Gemini's mirrors (obviously they are here for basic effect), but they are easy to cycle so I think are fine.
