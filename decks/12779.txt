-- 2GW8 + 3vp in final

Deck Name: Purple haze
Description: "It is a pity, that most of the pieces had to be swept from the board."
- Ambrosio Luis Monçada

Expect to have 3 vampires to work with. Depending on the draw, getting 9 cap and having 2 vamps to Govern down on Gratiano might be the way to go.

Path of Power gives me a better Seduction in Dominant Personality and a better Tenebrous Form in Unthinkable Humiliation

All 3 of the post-vote cards can be played at the same time, so there is a much lower chance of getting clogged than with the Voter Cap alone.
If you play all three on the single action, you get style points (and 6 pool)!
Unholy Sacrament is much easier to cycle than Zillah's.
Cold war is good, even for "just" 3 dmg, since there is no haggling over where the remaining one goes, unlike with KRC.
Obedience gives you confidence that your one unlocked vampire will not be locked when blocking.
