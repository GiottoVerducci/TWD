-- 3vp in final

Deck Name: Nosferatu Primogen rush/bleed 3.0

Description and report:
My third try with my beloved Nosferatu Primogen, the balance of cards finally paid off, on the first round I managed to control my prey that started too dtrong, and then lunged one prey after another, taking the GW with 5 vps. In the second round the game was tense, my Banu Haqim predator lunged for the last 3 pool, played a protected district, but another player on the table DI-zed my districted and I get out with nothing. On the final the table was Stanislava inner circles --> Banu Haqim v5 --> Lasombra Vote/bleed v5 --> Nosferatu Petrodon --> Nosferatu Primogen (me), the Staniscat managed to oust the Banus on a fierce turn, the Lasombra taked heavy punishment but managed to oust Petrodon and my kind, that pissed me off, and I rushed the famous Stanisgirl out of game and my primogens get toe to toe with the Lasombras, with the districts i managed to survive the bleeds and make the political actions dificult, with time I get all Lasombras on torpor at expense of the Dowager, Larissa and Zelios bleeded my vampireless prey out of this tense and funny final game.
