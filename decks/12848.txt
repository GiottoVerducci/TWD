Deck Name: Barons Toolbox
Description: Deck feels solid. Build up a board first, block key actions where possible. Then either lunge if there's the occasion or grind the opponent down. Sometimes you draw too many of your conditioning and earth control early. I would like to try a Club Illusion as a backup plan when that happens, it could probably replace Pentex(TM) Subversion.
