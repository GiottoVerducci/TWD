Deck Name: Obey Redux

Vote and bleed down prey, and reassign pool via Parity Shifts to keep
others from being ousted; bounce with Deflections and reduce combat
with Obedience and Read Intentions; slow to start up and weak against
Grapples and heavy combat, but tends to keep things interesting, as
passing votes is rarely a problem.
