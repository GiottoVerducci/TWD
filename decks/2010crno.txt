Deck Name: Putting "The Dominate" in Indominatability

I played a similar deck a number of years ago at Origins. That deck revolved
more around the combat aspect itself, using Animalism for Drawing Out the Beast.
Camera Phone seems to be my new favorite card and I keep wanting to put them
in most of my decks.

The deck was definitely supposed to have 2 Graverobbing. It's a huge mistake,
since that was the inspiration for me to change the deck in the first place.
I'd probably drop a Superior Mettle and a Rapid Healing for them.
