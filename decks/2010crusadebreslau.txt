-- 3GW9.5 + 1.5VP in final

Deck Name: Nephandi in Drop Pods

Designed by: Pawel Kukielczynski & Tomasz Pietkiewicz

Deck scored 3GW9.5 + 1.5VP in final, splitting it with Piper Ghouls and
thus winning due to being top seated. Pawel played 1.5 hour without vampires
(Antonio was stolen via Temptation of Greater Power with a bargain price of 12 pool ^^)
and still managed to oust his prey with 3 Nephandi and Carlton van Wyk
and last to the timeout.
