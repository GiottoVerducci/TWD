Deck Name: AD&D (Advanced Derange & Dementia)

Description: The same deck I played before, this time with slight
alterations, as I found Unmada too important to miss in the opening
crypt. Temptation of Greater Power was actually an excellent addition.
If you want to use the combo in every single game (which I didn't),
I'd suggest playing more copies of the key cards: Derange, Dementia and
Enkil Cog.
