Deck Name: All You Need Is Oust

The deck is straight forward offense. The only action in the deck that
doesn't have any offensive potential is Carlton Van Wyck which I threw
in last minute. Get out 2 vampires and try to bleed, vote and recruit
with them each turn. The first action is usually the most important
and has the Uncontrolled Impulse to push it through. Majesty and
change of target gets through and defenders until you can get your
actions through. Decent pool gain to slow down your predator. If you
are in a really bad spot, bloat and vote upstream. Don't bother
leaving any vampires for blocking unless you don't have any actions
left, or you are looking at static intercept combat with no modifiers
to push your actions through.
