-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: The new A

Description: Classic Triple A concept enhanced with the new big A, Ashur Tablets.

The only change I would make in this deck is to add an Anarchist Uprising
and an Archon (look, more A's!) and cut out a Perpetual Care and a Psyche.
I had not realized Alastor doesn't allow you to rush allies and that was
mighty annoying in two of the four games.

The two cards that got my the win today were Metro Underground (having
an untapped Assault Rifle is *huge*) and the Entrancement, that I could
play unblockable in the finals to steal a Nephandus, bring it back to
my hand with Ashur's the next turn and steal another Nephandus.
