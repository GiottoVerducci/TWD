Deck Name: Chameleon Snakes

Description: Credit where credit is due. I had built a Chamelon module
into a Ayo-Anarch deck a while back, and as such was familiar with the
mechanics of it, but Matt Wedge took it to a new level. He proposed a
mono-Snake deck accelerated by Eternals of Sirius. I've spent the last
8 months learning to build and play 60 card decks, more in the style of
Jay. I went Group 4 for this, because Nakhthorheb's inherent multi-acting
is so strong. Thanks also to Darby for some tweaks in the Master mix. I
would probably delete one of the support snakes in favor of a second
Cagliostro...synergy between him and Nak is huge.
