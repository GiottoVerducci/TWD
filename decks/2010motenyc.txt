Deck Name: Eldest are Ravnos

2GW10 (5VP in final)

Description	Bring out little Ravnos, who in turn bring out littler
Ravnos. Cycle Mozambique Allures easily by going Laibon and the
calling votes using Eldest are Kholo. Vote defense is also Eldest are
KHOLO!

A few comments on the deck:
Turns out the events were mostly useless, destroying my handsize. The
only time someone played the Uncoiling, I was glad to see it!
First time i try heart of Nizchetus: disapointing, i would have
prefered a tarot or another trinket...
Archon investigation was, once again, completely useless - being a
dead card for all the time i ever had it in hand.
Probably too many things going on in this deck, jammed a lot. Need to
cut down to 60-66 cards, notably the events, some masters and still
not convinced about the Eldest are kholo vote mechanism...
