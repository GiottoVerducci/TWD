Deck Name: Ahrimane Assault

Description:	Toolbox ahrimane. Lots of untap. Lots of carrion,
but no aid from bats ! The point is not to destroy the vampire you are
blocking, but merely being able to block a lot, and to survive the
ensuing fight. You are going to oust with Smiling jack anyway. Some
precise rush, mainly to maim the fame. Mark V is here to settle it
against other long range fighters.
