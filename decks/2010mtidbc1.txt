Deck Name: Trust in the Public
Created by: Robert Scythe

Description: I would like it known that I had forgotten my tin of
shared cards between decks and did not even mean to play this deck at
all but it was pretty much complete. A variation of my Superior Presents
deck that just goes hardcore into its first 2 prey and works on the 3rd
for the win. Came about from a discussion whether just going full head
on with trusts and Life in the City's would be even more effective.
They were.
