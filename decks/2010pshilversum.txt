-- 4VP in final

Deck Name: A Knight, a Crusader and an Artist

I had awful crypt draws in the preliminaries with me drawing all 5
Converts in the first 6 crypt cards in one game and only one Convert
in the first seven in the other two games. In the finals I actually
had a really good draw, so it can work. Some number tweaking is
probably in order.

I never needed Anarch Railroad, but the Free Press came in handy
quite a few times. I was considering to drop the Blood Dolls
altogether and in retrospect I should have. An extra Dreams and a few
Washes or Suddens would have helped greatly.

The Dutch meta has been loaded with allies for a while so I figured
Entrancement would be a safe bet. As it turned out, I didn't see a
single ally and mostly discarded them. 23 Undue Influence was a tad
bit too high. Should go down to 19 or 20.

This worked perfectly for me. My Enemy's Enemy was intended more as
intercept than as bounce and it did its job perfectly. Two or so more
wakes wouldn't be bad though, as I usually had to fully tap out
playing Undue Influence to keep pressure on my preys and get enough
"transfers" to be able to user my regular transfers to move crypt
cards to the uncontrolled region
