Robert Scythe

Deck Name: The Quick and the Dead

Description: Infernal Pursuits, Aura Readings and the Barrens to get
your guns on, Ashurs to get back all those necessary discards. In the
tournament I drew the Barrens in my opening hand all three games, too
good. All the Forceds would be Eyes if I owned that many, though I did
use a Forced on a Mind Raped, Pulsed Kallista with only one blood to
fail a block. There's usually another Quicken, 2 DI's and another
intercept location (really missed the DI's). This really wants at
least 1 Aire even if Marcellus cannot use it, and he needs to be the
main. Rather have a Jake than the Hunting Grounds.
