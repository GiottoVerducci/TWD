Deck Name: Mistress Fanchion doesn't have a Heart!
Created by: Matt Wedge & Michael Courtois

Description: The deck SHOULD have a Heart of Cheating but it was in
another deck and I forgot to add it before the tourney. Mistress must
get a Rutor's Hand first thing, then Alastor, then Helicopter, then
Magic the Ankara Citadel. From there, there is enough in the deck to go in
and look for the answer that is needed to attack or defend the game state.
Orlando is always your second minion to help grab the political reins at
the table. If all goes well, you'll be the last one standing.
