Deck Name: Salmon Fishstick
Created by: Matthew Morgan, based on Martin Major's deck

Description: It's rush combat with a strong master module. Master cards
are the best in the game. I'd always rather have too many than too few.
The name is because the final was won 2-1-1-1 and Fish and Stick lead the
way while Nana stayed hidden in my crypt. Fish is only in the deck to make
it count as a Guruhi deck for TWDA purposes.

One might wonder why only 4 Nana when she's the star? The answer is that
it's way better to have no Nana than all Nana. This deck needs a bunch of
minion actions to succeed

I really liked having AI here in the final, though I wound up not
playing it. Mbare Market probably isn't worth the slot. Should be a
2nd Fame, I think. Otherwise the masters worked out very well.

The Entrancement and Well-Marked didn't really earn their keep at any
point, though Well-Marked is typically a free action at least. I play
fewer Deep Songs than Martin's version because I'm not trying to rush
with every minion with every action. I bleed for 1 a little or stay up.
I want my prey to go forward. I don't want to simply squish him. Coming
out of the gate too fast is a mistake.

Very few reactions. Sense the Savage Way should probably go since only
Nana can play them. I had multiple situations where I would have liked to
block with somebody else but couldn't because of the restriction on that
card. Getting to 2 intercept is nice, but it isn't worth the cost.

Very consistent. Not a lot can survive repeated hits from this. Of course
it's not fun to run into other ANI decks, but them's the breaks.
