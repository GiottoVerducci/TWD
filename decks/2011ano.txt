Deck Name: 1...2...Skip a Few (turns)

Description: I had a deck like this back in 2001, added Papillion
and Lilith's Blessing, hoping to keep blood on the minions.
The deck is very fast and almost guarantees that a table will not
time out. It's difficult to not make a target of yourself early,
especially if the First Traditions come up. The deck runs well
without them, but they keep the pool/minion count low enough to
ensure an advantage in most cases. The Justicar Retribution was
the all-star heads-up in the finals, burning Stanislava when
I had complete vote control.
