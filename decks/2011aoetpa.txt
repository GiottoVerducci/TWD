Erol Hammer

-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Destructo
Created by: Erol (Original Version by Ivan Marin-Rivas)

Original Version had 15 Ashurs, 8 Liquidation and 3 Heroic Mights.
I reduced the numbers and put some Villeins in. IMHO it helped
a lot, regarding survivability. Always had enough combat cards
and rushes. I would only try to add following things, another
Monster, a Golconda, an additional Taste of Vitae. Dragonbound
could be an option, who knows?!?
