Martin Schumacher

Deck Name: Triple B (Bleed, Bruise & Block)

0, gw2, gw2 (4 players) + 3VP in final (2VP to Grand Prey)

Description: Govern is not that good here, since superior
can only be played on the 2 6-caps. Maybe 3 Govern
7 Conditioning is the way to go. Also I wanted to play
4 Flames of the Netherworld (but didnt't have any) and
6 Apportation, so I settled for 3 Walk of Flame and
7 Apportation. WoF was used once in 4 games so should
be cut, and Apportation should be upped to 8-10. Powerbase:
Barranquilla should go, I'd like to include 1 more Magic
of the Smith and a IR Goggles. Always!!! get Heart of
Cheating as fast as possible.
