Deck Name: Brujah Debate 60 cards

Description: Deck based on Johannes Walch's Brujah Debate deck
he played during WoN in June. I added 3 cards to the original deck -
Jake, Carlton and Aranthebes. I would add Dreams of the Sphinx
instead of Cryptic Rider. Aranthebes wasn't useful but it would
help to contest it with my prey if he had played one.

This deck has some potencial, but in case your pred/prey is playing
a deck with fast setup if is very difficult to get VP's. If mid game
you should have 15+ pool and several minions striking for 3+. Smiling
Jack is a good option for late game when playing against two players.
Brujah Debate deck is very strong when played agains unexperienced
player who had never pleayed agains it before and there are lots of
them as Brujah Debate decks are not so common these days.

I will play that deck during a bigger tournament in the future.
