Jeffrey Thompson

-- 2.5VP in final

Deck Name: Abusing the Public Trust is an Abomination

Zubeida leads the way, in his own Perfectionist manner, in righting the
wrongs done by those who are abusing the Public Trust. (Bleed, add
stealth, use the gained counter on an uncontrolled vampire, bring another
one into play that can do the same.) Frequently spent games with
2 vampires in torpor. Assembled in ~20 minutes the morning of the
tournament, it is missing the Freak Drives and Enticements and Wider
Views that surely could have made a difference in a few of the rounds.
Herbert Westin was nowhere to be found during the short time allowed
for assembly, so Robin Withers made it in instead.
