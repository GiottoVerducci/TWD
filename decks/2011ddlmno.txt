Deck Name: Judgment Columbus: Blocking is Pain

Description: I had a deck around 5 years ago that was played with
the "tap & cap" model - Villein, Papillon and Ashur's Tablets only
makes this better. The deck was conceived to punish many of the
wall-type decks, which are often in vogue around here. It's very
resilient, often difficult to oust, especially without having to
deal with Immortal Grapple.
