Deck Name: Saulot and Nergal dating
Created by: Isak Esbjörnsson Bjärmark

This deck is based on a deck constructed by Marko Lindroos.
Marko plays his deck with Possesion and Sargon fragment to
get Nergal back after Call the Great Beast. The really brilliant
thing Marko discovered with Saulot and Nergal dating is that
they are really stealthy and when outferiors comes in to account
there's alot of stealth available. Of course this deck will
not break a dedicated blocker, neutral guard helps though.

This deck is really defensive, or should be played that way
anyways. Saulot should go first to help out with getting the
other guys. Magic of the Smith should go on Heart first and
Magic of the Smith should be played as soon as posssible.
To keep the pressure up, bleeding with Saulot and Nergal
every turn is essential. Enkil Cog should go on Saulot.
