Deck Name: We Are the Land

2gw + 8VP headed into the finals

Description: A breed-and-boon deck which revolves around Guruhi Are
the Land: a free, versatile card which can provide situational untap,
extra blood when hunting, or +bleed. Dream World was ridiculously good,
but in two games getting No Secrets with the Kevlar Vest was the
game-breaker. For a future build, I would be tempted to include more
vests and No Secrets after the success it brought me, but the original
intent was for that to be a side feature of the deck.
