Deck Name: Dutch ECQ 2011: Vendetta: !Ventrue Grinder

Based on the standard Stick Men deck with some modifications.
There isn't much I would change to the deck. Was thinking about
including some Nose of the Hound but got convinced by several
players that bleeding is better the nosing.

In all four games I have discarded the hunting ground. It is a great
card when you get it in the first 2-3 turns but after that there are
better ways to spend the pool. I am thinking about replacing the
Hunting Ground with an Uncoiling. Several Event cards will make
the game a lot harder for this deck (Unmasking, Blood Weakens,
The Slow Withering) and having an option to get rid of them could
help a lot.
