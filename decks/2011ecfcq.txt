Deck Name: Nobody expects the Shattering Crescendo.

Original deck by Otso Saariluoma. Tweaked to handle a little bit more
intercept. I saw the idea on TWDA and since it featured two of my
favorite vampires I decided to try it out and loved the concept.
The concept is to get both Unmada and Scout Youngwood out, then recruit
your allies and call Parity Shifts and Reckless Agitations on your prey
to get him/her to Villein/tap or otherwise empty his/her vampires. Then
you start playing your shattering crescendos. Slow to start, but gets
stronger as the game progresses. I used to have another Dreams of the
Sphinx in the deck but it seems I put it in another deck since I use
this primarily for fun. It turned out well, since it would have just
contested on every table. I also noticed that in three of the four games
I played I managed to slow the Ashur decks considerably since I always
offered to play Ashurs after my opponents finished their first cycle if
they would also do the same. However, I only have one master phase and
six ashurs to start with and if the opponents stick to the deal it hurts
them in the long run.
