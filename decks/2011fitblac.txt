Deck Name: Dirty Sinks

This was a rehash of an older deck I had dismantled before KOT that I redesigned
with some newer cards and the hope that it played enough S:CE to survive Deep Song.
The deck never got to play a S:CE the entire tournament as every time it was in
combat it lacked one in hand, making me think it either needs 5-6 more or should
just remove all the No Trace and take your chances.

The crypt could also be tightened more to make the deck more consistent, I'd drop
everyone under 8 cap and play a few more copies of the Ventrue so I have more valid
targets for Zillah's Valley as multiple times I had 7 caps left over in my uncontrolled
region and no way to cycle a Zillah's Valley to burn the 5 pool. It would also
allow an inclusion of Ventrue Headquarters/Ephor with a significantly higher chance of
being able to put it into play.
