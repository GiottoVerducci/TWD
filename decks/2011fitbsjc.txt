Deck Name: Marcus, Marc and the Funky Bunch

Description: This is my Faerie Guardian deck with a couple of changes.
I put in a Lilith's Blessing for one of the Master Disipline cards
(not Presence, of course) and replaced a Wake with an Eternal Vigilance
nicking an idea from John Bell's more defensive Faerie Wards wall deck.
I didn't mean to play this deck again in a tournament but I hadn't taken
it apart and it felt right to play at the time. I did forget to put in
the 2 Perfect Paragons that absolutely belong in it, luckily they didn't
cost me the game.
