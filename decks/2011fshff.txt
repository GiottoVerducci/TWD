Deck Name: Toreador Power Bleed

Description: Use Enkidu for block denial and defense, monster
bleed with Andre, other weenies and the Codex once the coast is
clear. The combat module is based on the theory that if you have
enough Psyche! and Pursuit you can just dump combat cards until
you run into an Earth Meld and another rush card.

Casual observations:
the longest game I played in the tournament lasted for about 1h 15min
I still managed to deplete my library in every single game
