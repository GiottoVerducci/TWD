Deck Name: Nergal's a Beast
Created by: Matt Wedge & Robert Scythe based on a TWD by Tomàs López Jiménez

Description: With the fragility of a combo deck such as this we decided
to make it smaller and utilize Luc, as opposed to fortitiude buddies, for
his handsize ability and Pentex removal with more Obfuscate, plus Sense The
Sin just invites Archon Investigation to further impede it's flow. Swalloweds
are decent combat defense (and offense if The Beast needs to visit somebody)
and Gramle gets the card you need right now. Also with the larger handsize
the inclusion of one Pentex seemed like a necessary evil, for another way to
deal with it or to just use it offensively.
