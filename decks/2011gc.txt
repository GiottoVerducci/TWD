Deck Name: Triple B (Bleed, Bruise & Block)

Description: Did some of the changes I talked
about after Arnheim last week. Ditched the Governs
for more Conditionig, which worked very well. Added
another Valerius ADV cause I expected S&B (I was wrong).
Added 1 Magic/ 1 IR Goggles, had no impact. Still played
Walk of Flame, was useless again, need to get my hands on
some Flames of the Netherworld. Put in Smiling Jack, but
the deck is not blocky enough to defend it against more
than 1 player. Missed Chantry a whole lot this tourney,
might put it in instead of Jack. This deck could really
benefit from 2-3 Nose of the Hound to get rid of deflectors
before lunging, need to make room.
