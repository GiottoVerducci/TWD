Deck Name: Glöggansiktet Gerald
Created by: Stefan Karlsson (with moral support by Isak Esbjörnsson Bjärmark)

Description: This is some sort of Freak Show but I can not
stress enough that this is no one-turn deck. Ankara Citadel
first of course and then tool up with 5-10 actions each turn,
one of them being a bleed as big as possible that needs to
end up at prey's pool. The recursable Command the Legion
and Revelations makes this deck shine, everything else is
situational.
