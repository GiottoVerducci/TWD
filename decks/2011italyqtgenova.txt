Deck Name: Para Bailar la Bamba

Description: A breed and vote deck with Bamba and Amaravati,
taking advantage of a good laibon spread into the Assamite clan.
The main idea is to breed enough Bambas, bleed occasionally to
charge Alamut, bloat with Haquim's Law and Boon, then go for the
killing with Khabar: Community and Veil the Leigion for bleed and
big votes like Reckless
