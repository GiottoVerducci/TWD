-- 4VP in final

Deck Name: Armin Hammer

The deck plays generally the same as any stealth/vote deck with a more
interesting stealth module. Ideally Armin Brenner is your first
minion and should always be first unless he isn't in your opening
crypt. He is the only minion in the crypt that can maximize the use
of all cards in the crypt and his 1 pool/vote adds up over the course
of the game. The deck will play quite a few cards each turn and
maximizing cards like Forced March for stealth and untap is key.

The deck can generally bloat fast enough to handle a moderately fast
bleeding predator and Majesty or Resist Earth's Grasp will slow down
Animalism rush significantly while accepting that a Grappling foe will
kill the deck. Undele is key for late game antics to make sure your
two other actions/turn are exactly what you want them to be.

While it never showed, gaining potentially 5 pool calling a Black
Forest Base action is rather nice. The changes I would make after
playing it outside of the local playgroup would be two fewer KRCs and
another Neonate Breach and then some other damage vote or maybe even
a utility vote like Snipe Hunt/Permanent Vacation to take out late
threats that can be brought back. Delaying Tactics recycled in the
finals against me slowed down my offense several turns.
