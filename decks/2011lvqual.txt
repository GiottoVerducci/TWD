-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Ira
Created by: Matt Guinn, modified by David Tatu

Matt Guinn gave me this deck that he won Guide and Mentor: Atlanta
with last month. I made a few changes but the cards I put in never
saw play or did not make any difference during the event. So his
original version is probably better. It is a very good deck, much
stronger than what I typically build and play and it was a lot of fun
to run. Thanks Matt for the deck and thanks to Kevin for another great
event in Las Vegas. Wish we did not have to wait another year for the
next one.
