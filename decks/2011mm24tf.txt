I guess you could call this an Edward Vignes deck without Edward Vignes.
Anson for extra masters and a nice little vote module. Second tournament,
second final table with first seed. The deck doesn't really bloat too much
but it can outlast quite a many threats. I'd change few cards but nothing
big. Secure Haven saved Anson's sweet *** in two games out of three when
facing grapple rush or blood suckers like Gabrielle di Righetti & Francois
Villon (played by prey and predator).
