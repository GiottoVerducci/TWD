Deck Name: Mordechai Ben Nun & Friends HATE THE IMBUED!

Description: After snatching defeat from the jaws of victory one
too many times while facing the imbued, I decided I wanted to make
a deck that could effectively deal with them.
Thus, the inspiration for this deck.
Mordechai is the super star. Want to:
- burn allies (Mercy of Seth)
- block actions (built in +1 int, plus AUS)
- burn ash heap power/conviction cards (Trochomancy)

Crypt (12 cards, min=23, max=32, avg=7.08)
