Deck Name: Vigilant Luc

Slow Darby-dance deck with some stealth.
Luc is key minion. His stealth and card cycling ability are crucial.
After tournament I would remove Parthenon and 1 Determine and 1 Rejuvenate.
Psychic veil was never played, but seems to be useful.
Would add "Not to be" or 1 more DI.
