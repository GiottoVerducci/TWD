Powerbase: Los Angeles Event #2 - Southwest Regional Qualifier
Gamex, Los Angeles, California

Robert Scythe

Deck Name: Girls Will Infect Los Angeles
Created by: Another slight variation of the Esbjornsson TWD

Description: I used an idea from Angseesing with the Unleash Hell's
Fury (that I never got to play). If I had only played the deck before
the tournament I would have made more changes and taken some credit
for the design but as is it all goes to Esbjornsson/Torstensson
