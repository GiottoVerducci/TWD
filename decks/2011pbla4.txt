Deck Name: Govern is Weak Sauce

Based on/Inspired by: Original deck design.

Description: This deck tries to exploit a card I believed grossly
overpowered as early as the first glimpse - Brutal Influence.

In this tournament I don't think I ever got above 6 Orun on a single
vampire for various reasons (predator-based rush, cross table Sense
Dep, Pentex, contestation). Even at that modest level it's a
double-strength superior Govern the Unaligned and almost triple-strength
Govern bleed. Seems pretty good to me, despite the overhead.

The Banishment/Exile module is intended to eliminate bleed deflectors.
It also provides a great deal of flexibility to deal with other situations,
including players at the table whose pool management is entirely
recursion-based (e.g., Villein + Lilith's Blessing) or handling
players running 11/12-cap minions.
