Deck Name: Anger Management

Osebo intercept/combat with Andre added as an opportunistic
ousting mechanism. In order to get GWs, this deck needs
quite a few turns, so one or two players should be
eliminated quickly; don't hesitate to rush cross-table
and/or backoust to bring the table down to three players
as fast as possible.
