-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Nicole's Angry Dragon

Changed the Osebo starter I played a few weeks ago and seemed to do Ok....
mainly because no one had Superior Obfuscate at the tables I was in. Also,
thanks to Mark Loughman for suggesting and hooking me up with 2 more No
Secrets before the tournament. Definitely needed them, as Block Fail is
fairly common....
