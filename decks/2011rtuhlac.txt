Deck Name: Faerie Guardian

Description: I've always disliked Archon Investigation because,
though it takes a big bleeder off you, it hurts my predator too much
(unless he's just a heavy stealth bleeder) and Faerie Wards does
exactly what I like, stopping the bleeds and holding them down. Also
great for all other D actions. Shroud of Absence and Stone Travel help
to not need any combat at all, though I suppose a couple of Majesty's
could help but it was cool like this. Trick is to have Marconius
become the biggest vampire on the table, too bad he doesn't come with
protean.
