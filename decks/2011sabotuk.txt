Deck Name: Bitey Wizards
Created by: Dave Knowles // Shockwave @ #vtes

Thanks to #vtes on SorceryNet for critiqueing this
deck a million times for me, and Hugh & John for
putting up with oddball ideas when I should be
playing something more sensible.

Beatrice is *golden*. Leech, burn the Second Sight when
announced, untap, bleed with pot options that worry people.
I'm tempted to have an extra one. Keith and Esoara have never
seen play.

Seems to flow just about right, maybe needs another Intercept location.

Veil of Darkness kills tables. Everyone will hate you
for it (and with good reason), but it's pretty much a key
card to drop via Fortschritt if necessary. It saves me
repeatedly, including killing the Stealth on the Ancilla
Empowerment that would have killed me in the final.

Probably needs 1-2 more Actions, no idea what to lose to manage it, though.

I have no idea why the more common Nephandus deck runs 10.
I never see 10, I never can afford 10, and I run out of turns
before I'd get 10. Young Bloods and Carlton can also Leech.

Once again, a smidge too light, really.

The kicker. Nobody expects a Nephandus to Disarm you,
and nobody expects a Nephandus to survive a Torn Signpost
*and* Disarm you.
