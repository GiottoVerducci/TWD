-- 5VP in final

Deck Name: Samedi

My first 2 rounds were sub-standard as I made a few misplays. Pressing
the Flesh of a Muddled Vampire Hunter in round 3 and the final really
sealed it for me. The Guardian Angel can come out as well as the
Conceal. Inferior obfuscate on all my guys was kind of annoying. It
may need a try with the 2/3 crowd.
