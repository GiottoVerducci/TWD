Deck Name: What the Flock?!

Description: Cybele's master phases are key to working the
Tend the Flocks for either speed or pool generation.
The Ashur Tablets give me freedom to move cards quickly
while allowing me to retrieve them for later when I need
to tune my hand. The idea is to be able to have permanent
+bleed on as many minions as possible, lay as low as possible
and bloat to live.
