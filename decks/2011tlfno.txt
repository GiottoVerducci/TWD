Deck Name: Ishtarri No Ayo

Description: Most of the decks I've seen with the Ishtarri
revolve around Ayo and voting, I wanted to go a different
angle with this deck. The original concept was to have multiple
informants out so that I could have an idea of what everyone
held in their hand. It was built as a combat/wall deck and
spends a lot of time sitting around trying to build up.
The No Secrets can often get burned, but isn't a disaster
since there are more to be had.

Should remove Shasa and Honorine for 2x Ayo Igoli,
I didn't want to invest that much into a single minion
with this deck, but she's really good for it.

Enchants should be changed to Entrancement

I would consider dropping the hunting ground for Carlton van Wyk, who should have been in here to start with.

Both Wakes should be changed for On the Qui Vive which would allow me to throw a Procurer in the way of a rush-action.
