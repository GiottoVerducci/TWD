Deck Name: Homeland Recurred

Description: The deck was a lot of fun, but it really needed
a lot of cycling. The Recure the Homeland was the all start
with Burst of Sunlight and Target Vitals, it really did lots
of damage. The trick of this deck is to tool up while bounding
bleeds forwards and backwards around the table, the My Enemies
Enemy are quite intentional, as this deck doesn't go forward
too hard, which means my prey gets going, taking table pressure
off my grand predator, I try to fix that here. The allies and
Terrell Harding (wider view needs to be here) suck some blood off
as a means to stop Deflections when you do lunge forward.
In round one after having 2 allies burned and my first vampire
with a Vessel, Blood Doll, Ivory Bow and Rutor's Hand on turn 4,
I managed to lunge for 12 undeflected 4 turns later with the
Heidelberg, all the time just bouncing and tweaking blood off
vampires. Society of Leopold takes a very close 2nd to all
star card, it really allowed me to stop other methheads as
needed. This deck was something I tooled with on JOL, it
never did well and I rebuilt it the morning of the event,
it does have flow problems, so note if you play it, you will
be discarding every turn if you want a chance in hell. Truth
be told, my win came from luck, and my ability to capitalize
on it. The last bit of advice, ditch the harvest rites, trust
me, they suck here. Thanks to Jay for getting such a large
showing from Columbus and to the Newark crew for making it out!
