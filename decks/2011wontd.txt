Deck Name: Balls of Stihl
Created by: Darby Keeney, based on a John Eno design.

Description: (Imbued Chainsaw Rush)

A couple of years ago, John stitched the Chainsaw rush into
a Dancing Imbued deck and the two of us tuned the deck into
the current state over a couple of months.

It is a bit more fragile than some of the intermediate builds
but is consistent. I considered adding Veil of Darkness and
the Rising, but opted to leave them out for this run.

My favorite moment of the tourament win with this deck was
bleeding with the Vagabound Mystic, who had successfully
equipped a Laptop Computer, IR Goggles, Leather Jacket and
the Heart of Nizchetus.
