-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Tzimisce bleed with Asanbonsam Ghouls

Description: Great deck to play - other players are always
guessing if I have aggro cards in my hand. Smiling Jack is
very effective especially when played very early in the game.
Big disagvantege of this deck is it's speed - it's simply too
slow. Advanteges - played 6 tournament games - never won less
then 0.5VP . I would exchange some cards for more T.Vitals or
Rotschrecks.
