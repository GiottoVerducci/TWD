Deck Name: Shamblingi dla Zygi (Shamblings for Zyga)

Description: I've made that deck for my friend Zyga, who has recently sold
his collection. Unfortunatelly he was unable to play with us, so I decided
to try this deck out. That was the first time I had played a Gio Shambling
deck. It is based on Isak Esbjörnsson Bjärmark's "Sudario Hordes" deck with
some minor changes. I managed to win all three tables with 3GW and 10VP
in total. It's a nice - strong deck, but I'd add 2 x Adrea to bypass
+1 intercept blockers. Some Taget Vitals would be also vital in this deck.
