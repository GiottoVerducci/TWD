Deck Name: Sudden Reversal Monstrosity

Probably one of more vicious and aggressive decks I have built.
The idea is denying opponents key resources in the form of their
Masters. The obvious choices are prey's pool gain and predator's
offensive cards, but it becomes more difficult to decide what
permanents to allow in play across table. The stealth-bleed module
works quite well without a single master, but the deck funcitons
under the assumption that many decks are crippled without their
master phases.The deck physically can not bleed for greater than
3, which means I have no worries for Archon Investigation and
bounce isn't as crippling as when a bleed of 6 is redirected.
The pool generation in the deck mostly comes from Kindred Spirits,
ousting my prey, or The Call in a pinch.
