Deck Name: Czech ECQ 2012 - Guns N' Roses

About deck- block, block, block... work on poolgain, try to get
Magnum on Ira as fast as you can and keep Rack/Vessel/Montreal
for pools... its good idea to put Rack+2 Vessel on Yvette/Sabrina
and just stand and block and gain pools... well worked for me perfectly
