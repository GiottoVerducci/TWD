Deck Name: Ghouls Occupy Wall Street

Description: Adam Hulse Winning Deck (Boston Qualifier 2012)
Even the ghouls have begun to protest! The ring leader is a very
charismatic Smiling Jack. Very peacefully mind you. But when you
get them riled up they go to your home and assault your corporations
with sticks and bats!
