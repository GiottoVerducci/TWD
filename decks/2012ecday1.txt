Deck Name: EC 2012 Day 1: Unmada and Lutz

I won the EC day one in 2012 with this deck, it is a version of the
deck I used to win the NAC day one but with even more crypt acceleration
as I have seen more wash in my home meta (to counter crypt acceleration).
So I decided to use even more Zillah's and a few distraction.
