-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Enkidu PRO CEL

I got some inspiration from Aleksi Nuora's TWD to build this one.
Protean and Celerity are great costless polyvalent combat
disciplines (there are only 3 Claws that cost blood amongst
the 60 combat cards). I playtested and tweaked it lots of
time during our weekly session (thanks to my patient victims)
and I'm quite happy about it.

Enkidu in 5 copies sometimes didn't show up. I added one copy (with a 13-crypt card to draw more side-kicks)

Master come quite quickly because you cycle lots of cards.
--You can even jam with master even there are only 11 of them, but it's quite rare.

Crypt (13 cards, min=7, max=44, avg=6.31)

Library (90 cards)
Master (11; 2 trifle)
4x Blood Doll -- slow pool gain and blood management to feed Enkidu.
1x Guardian Angel -- the permanent "prevent 1" is a real life saver.
1x Monster -- permanent untap
1x Pentex(TM) Subversion -- for contest or to lock an annoying minion (Ponticulus or the guy with the gun). Can also slow down your predator when you don't have Enkidu yet)
2x Sudden Reversal -- To be kept against Pentex, Temptation of Greater Power etc.
2x Wider View

Action (8)
1x Aranthebes, The Immortal -- as always, to contest or to give me some protection against weenie decks (or even intercept... it's a great card)
1x Bum's Rush
1x Deep Song
1x Heroic Might -- makes some combat easier, but is not vital
2x Rumble
1x Sense Death
1x Taunt the Caged Beast

Equipment (1)
1x Gran Madre di Dio, Italy -- against Tupdogs, Nocturns...

Retainer (2)
1x Homunculus -- not vital, but useful once you have Enkil Cog
1x Raven Spy -- helpful, but not vital.

Action Modifier (2)
2x Enkil Cog -- allows permanent multirush and can give the edge during's your predator's turn. The +1 bleed is great also. Really a key card.

Reaction (6)
6x Sense the Savage Way -- to block of course, but protects also against RÃ¶tschreck/Mind Numb/Sensory Deprivation

Combat (60)
3x Canine Horde -- why play Drawing when you can get rid of that Ivory Bow/.44 Magnum or Heart of Nizchetus?
3x Claws of the Dead -- should always be used to burn vampires. Can get rid of Ponticulus/Tye/Ambrosius
9x Earth Meld -- defensive, untap, works well with Psyche! and is free. Can't ask for more
2x Flesh of Marble -- cycles easily, handles War Ghoul/Carrion/.44 blur etc.
1x Infernal Pursuit -- useful when you need to draw some key cards or discard master that clog the hand
16x Psyche! -- key card, even 16 are sometimes not enough
11x Pursuit
2x Skin of Steel
4x Stutter-Step -- saves slots, can be used by the sidekicks to dodge
9x Taste of Vitae
