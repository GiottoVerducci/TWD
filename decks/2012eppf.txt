Deck Name: True Brujah Wall

The deck is fairly resilient. It's some kind of Una mono-vampire
machine, with intercept provided by the Anima Gatherings (so, yes,
it IS a True Brujah Wall deck). Enkil Cog is pretty much a GW-insurance.
During the rounds, a few points were important:
- Powerbase Zurich would be an extremely nice addition.
- Summon History could be added (up to 3 copies)
- Perfect Paragon isn't as good as Tangle Atropo's Hand.
