Deck Name: Euro Brujah

We've all seen it before. Conditioning/Deflection and Torn
Signpost/Immortal Grapple. Has an assortment of Celerity and
Taste of Vitae for combat and the bare minimum of master cards.

My own flavor was a couple of political actions and Judgement:
Camarilla Segregation. I chose Flurry of Action for its dual use.
