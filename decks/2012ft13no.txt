Deck Name: The Terrible Two's

Description: The burn option mechanic really helps to get the
permanents into play quickly while not having to stack multiple
copies of several cards. The deck works really well in a low
intercept environment and it doesn't particularly like combat
either. The main defenses are to have numbers, bloat and use
the Hungry Coyote to keep rescuing or embracing. The Waste
Management Op is really strong once the library is depleted -
in the finals I was able to retrieve Delaying Tactics to
repeatedly stymie Anarchist Uprising which would have hit me
for 22 pool.
