Deck Name: Gehenna is a Hoax: Triple B (Bleed, Bruise, Block)

2GW8.5 (1st seed) + 1.5VP with 4 Players remaining.


Latest additions are Haven Uncovered, which is gold as the action to
remove the haven is basically another rush. Finally replaced Walk of
Flame with Flames of the Netherworld, which is also a good thing.
And yes, you do need 2 Hearts, because if u draw it and can't use
Magic, it will almost certainly get blocked.
