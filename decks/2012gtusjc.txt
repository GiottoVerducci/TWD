Deck Name: Extremely Silent and Incredibly Far Away

This is a modification of an old deck idea where I tried to have
Tariq "atone" and block everything. This version is much more
balanced and simply tries to use Tariq's abilities with the possiblity
of an Atonement. I can already see a few flaws in the design.
I think I'll dump the Necromancy and Anima Gathering angles and
just put in more reactions and action mods.

I was very fortunate to win the tourney. It was a really fun final
and very competitive. David Anderson as my prey looked like he had
it until Brett "archoned" his Mu-aziz. I lost Tariq to Brett's Carlton
but was able to bleed out David with what I had left and hold on until
the game timed out.
