Deck Name: The Princess and her Mistress
Created by: Mark Loughman (slightly modified by John Bell)

When I came back to VTES about 2 years ago, I built Mark Loughman's
"Traditional Princess" deck www.veknfrance.com/decks/twd.htm#2k9glrqco
and played it a few times casually. It really changed the way I looked at
the game and deck construction in general. I give him (and this deck)
a big credit to my successes since then. I did make some changes for
the tournament - mostly adding Mistress Fanchon and Villeins.
Fanchon's ability is so good for this kind of toolboxy deck,
I may even add more of her the next time I update it.
