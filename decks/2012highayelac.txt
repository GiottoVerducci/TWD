-- 3.5VP in final

Deck Name: Animal Trackers

Description: This was a rather old deck that had been updated
with newer cards for kicks. I hardly played it, however, because
of the popularity of animalism. When the tournament was about to
begin all of my decks were kind of in pieces, so I grabbed this one
- miscounted how many cards were in it (should have left it as
it was) - and proceeded to add in 4 Ashur's and an HoN. Well,
3 of the Tablets and an Anton (there were 4 originally) fell
under a table. I noticed the crypt shortage and tossed in another
Taylor from a different deck but did not notice the fallen Lbrary
cards, thankfully, since that would have made it 92 cards and
illegal. I did have to contend with one useless Ashur's and a
card ratio I would want to tweak but the deck drew well all
tournament. It is focused on dealing with S:CE and did a
commendable job. Anton and The Taylor came out every round
and at least one other, would change it to 4 and 4 and add
another Wider View or 2.
