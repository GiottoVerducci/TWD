-- 5VP in final

Deck Name: Heavy duty

Description: Shameless obf dom S&B. A lot of titles for table control
and vote protection. There is also a sizable reaction package for bleed
defence. Using murmur of the false will as main defence gives this deck
a great advantage, not only because it can be used for bleeding and
bouncing, but because it is free. Vampires can be villeined to very
little blood as governs are almost only ways of losing blood.
This deck is obviously very vulnerable to rushes but votes work pretty
well as protection against diableries as well. Secure Haven, Golconda,
Reins of Power and Obediences would be great additions to this deck but
it would require taking something else out.
