Deck Name: Tribute to Jay 2

Jay Kristoff has inspired previous decks of mine (http://thelasombra.com/decks/twd.htm#2k7ctw1),
and this deck was also inspired by him, hence the name. You can read all about his deck here:

With some research from Mephistopheles, Jay outlined 6 design goals for his deck:
1) 9-12 different vampires without a star
2) Many pool generating cards
3) Cards that move vamps from crypt to uncontrolled
4) 60 cards
5) Doesn't appear frightening
6) Unusual

I started by thinking about what +2 Pool action I could take. It's hard to get that many Art Scams,
so I settled on Dark Mirror of the Mind. Then I had to figure out how to get a bunch of 8+ caps.
Eternals of Sirius was the best answer I could find, and it also solved #3 since I could use Mesu
Bedshet. I think I succeeded on all the design goals except #5, since it's really hard to convince
people that you're not frightening when you have 5 or more 8+ caps.
