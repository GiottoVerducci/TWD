Deck Name: The Spanish Tornado
Created by: Soufiane Bouzouf, modifications by Jorge Delgado

Qualified last for the final (with only 2VP and no GWs). I think I had
very bad luck with table positions in the whole tournament in general,
where I tried desperately to maximize my VPs, but was victim of multiple
rushes in 2/3 tables. In the final I think I had really good luck with
the positions (since I entered last). That, plus my patience, plus
Guilhem's kamikaze gameplay gave me the GW.

Didn't have any Jackie, so in fact it should be -1 Eddie Gaines and
+1 Jackie. I'm actually thinking of taking out 1 Misdirection and
1 Tribute to the Master to include 1 Sudden Reversal. The deck works
quite ok in General.
