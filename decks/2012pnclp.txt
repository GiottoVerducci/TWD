Deck Name: Better Gents, Same Sticks, No Parity Shifts. Ever.

Description: Govern Superior as much as possible.
Most times, people don't see this deck as the table threat, even after 4 minions.
I think it's because players have irrational fears of stealth, big cap vampires,
players with vote lock, pure rush, walls...
I'm happy with list. Almost the same list that I took to the Final of EC 2012.

Crypt is fine.
Mary Anne Blaire is bad in this deck. Takes a long time to influence and would
require Freak Drives to use properly. Rather have 2 vampires by the same time
I would have Mary.

Consciously not using Scourge of the Enochians in the EC was probably
one of my worse mistakes in VtES ever.

14 is the new 10

Great card here. 90% of the time, used for bleed, but even more useful
those 10% of times you need to bounce a Giovanni or Kiasyd mega bleeder.

The quantity of bounce allows for the combat to be more offensive.
Second Tradition and Lodin are even more awesome together.
Might add an 8th Second Tradition.
