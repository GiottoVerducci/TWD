Deck Name: Torelando
Created by: Matthew Morgan and Kevin J. Mergen

Description: Won DC qualifier September 22, 2012.

Never saw the Ventrue at all in four rounds but otherwise
had good crypt draws.

Villein always clumped but otherwise enabled the deck.
I Pacted Orlando for Presence a couple of times and
voter capped with him for about 15 once. I wouldn't
consider it an integral component though.

Could have played a couple Entrancements,
but they wouldn't have helped.

Anything missing? I don't think so.
This all worked really well.

Could have had more stealth but I didn't ever face
heavy intercept as my prey. I had a wall in the
predator position round 2 and got blocked a bit,
but I basically just took the table by bleeding
forward.

Maybe too much. Bloat and payload is what this deck is about.

Torrent was never played. Probably not a good choice
for this deck as there isn't enough CEL.

Didn't have a lot of use for these. I love Scalpel Tongue
but didn't need it often. REG is a great card for Toreador,
but unplayable by Orlando.
