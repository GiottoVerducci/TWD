Deck Name: Ghouls Occupy Wall Street version 2

Even the ghouls have begun to protest! The ring leader
is a very charismatic Smiling Jack. Very peacefully mind you.
But when you get them riled up they go to your home and assault
your corporations with sticks and bats!

[This is version 2, version 1 won the 2012 Boston TempleCon Qualifier,
which can be found at http://www.veknfrance.com/decks/twd.htm#2012ctqwri]

Version 3 was played for Day 2 NAC, but couldn't beat
the mighty Martin (congrats btw!). Some interesting
discussion how to give it a little more forward power)
