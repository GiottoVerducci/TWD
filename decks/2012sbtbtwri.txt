Deck Name: What the... Ravnos?

Vaclav Petalengro showed up in my crypt draw every single round,
and every single round, my response was 'What the heck are you
doing in this deck?' He's got ANI and fort, but there has got to
be something better to replace him with, even an Anarch Convert
would probably be an improvement. I'd be seriously tempted to try
replacing him with a second Ingrid if I play this again. The game
I got her out, she was a huge benefit, mostly due to her +2 transfers.
All the other vampires in my crypt draw were always preferable
to Vaclav, which really says something.

I'd probably also try to put in more Freak Drives, and definitely
more Deep Songs, I only own one, thus the lack of them in the deck.
Other than that, it's a Gangrel deck that does Gangrel things.
