Deck Name: Mary Anne's Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day

Despite my star vampire getting burned by Archon Investigation
in the first round (leaving my prey at 1 pool, and then I'm ousted
before I get him), diablerized in the second round, and having
to use Daring the Dawn in the finals, Mary Anne's buddies were
able to pick up the pieces when it counted.
