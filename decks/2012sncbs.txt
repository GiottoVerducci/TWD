Deck Name: White Wedding

Description: This deck, even tho it looks like standard Spirit
Marionette hijacker, is in fact stealth & bleed deck that uses
people's fear of Marionette+Heidelberg Castle to make them tap
thus shutting down block/bleed redirection defense of prey (also
it stops predator from blocking undirected actions easely).
Paying 3 pool in order to have a team of Salubris is not so bad
since their texts generate way more pool then that, and AUS
smallcaps make good and cheap support/defense. The dreaded
German castle is of course used to strip marionetted vampires
off their blood, but since most of the time people will be tapped
its main use is to make lunge attacks with bleed retainers.
In retrospect i would add some 5-10 cards since this deck burns
alot of cards each turn, which resulted in me being decked out
3 out of 4 rounds i played. I had 2GW8 pre-finals, 2GW10 total.
