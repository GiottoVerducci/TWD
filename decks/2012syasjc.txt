Deck Name: Third Party Politics - Velya for President

A somewhat traditional "tap and cap" deck backed up with
the stealth offered by Vicissitude. I was pretty fortunate
in that I didn't face a real wall deck, and I was the only
political deck in the finals. But it is pretty ridiculous
how much pool this deck can acquire.

Crypt Selection: Velya and Lambach are the stars. Obviously
it is best for Velya to use Voter Cap, but refilling Lambach
for future Minion Taps is pretty good. I think there are a
couple of modifications that could be made to this deck.
More copies of Sascha Vykos (adv) could be added - she has
an amazingly good ability, but it is frustrating that she
can't use Mind of the Wilds for stealth. Sames goes for
Matteus, Flesh Sculptor (!Toreador) who could replace Meshenka.

Library: Over all, I was pleased with the amount of defense
(combat and bounce), stealth, and vote push this deck packs.
I only saw early crypt acceleration in one game, but it seems
hard to justify adding any more. On hind sight, I would
definitely drop the Crusade. I was surprised how often I
ended using Changeling to bleed.
