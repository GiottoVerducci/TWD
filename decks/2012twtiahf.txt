Deck Name: Undele's Bag of Dicks

Description: Bring out big guys with Zillah's to secure a fast vote lock,
proceed to win with Undele. For defending and breaking stalemates, pull dick
moves like recycling Banishment, DI, Entrancement or Pentex. Very difficult
to stop by the time it gets a third minion out.
The burn option cards are a mix of whatever I had within arm's reach at the
time I built the deck. Ideally, they would all be masters to feed Anthelios.
The deck needs a sixth Villein in order to draw one reliably and early,
probably in place of Golconda or Giant's Blood. If I was expecting heavy
bleeding I would also add a second Protected Resources.
