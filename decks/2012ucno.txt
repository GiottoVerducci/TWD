Deck Name: Brad's Angry Dragon

Description: Deck idea shamelessly stolen from a deck Mattias
played at last year's NAC. I made some alterations mainly in
the bloat/blood gain mechanisms for the deck as well as wanting
to remain firmly at 60 cards maximum (with Ashur Tablets). Some
changes would be ensure The Unmasking was included as well as a
Direct Intervention and perhaps 2 Freak Drives - I often found
myself with the difficult choice of playing Renewed Vigor on
Anu or a Spirit Marionette on my prey. Heidelberg Castle would
have also made a fine addition.
