Deck Name: The Ghosts of Your Loss

My first Harbinger deck. Everything worked like a dream.
Card cycle was awesome with all the vampire specials, Maabara, Fragment,
Gear Ups and Dreams. Anarch Converts are there mainly because I don't own
any more Harbingers than that.
In the future I would drop the Murder of Crows, reduce Trochomancy by 2,
add a Kiss of Ra and maybe 1 Gear Up or 2 Carrion Crows. The deck itself
is too big. I'd try to reduce the decksize to 80.
