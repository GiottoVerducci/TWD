Deck Name: The Gospel According To Set

Description: This deck can be rather difficult to play, but
is pretty fun. With self Temptations, Firebrands and
Abdelsobek a lot of Multi-acting nonsense ensues. One of the
Obfuscate cards should be a Serpentis, Carlton Van Wyk should
probably just replace the Set's Curse and The Uncoiling was
in here, dammit, it even fits thematically.
