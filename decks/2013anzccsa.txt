Deck Name: The Quiet Achiever 2013

Description: A 2013 incarnation of the deck I used to
win the 2005 Australian Championships. This deck never
seems to do much, but is very effective. Table play is
critical, especially early on. Most VP's scored by "lunging"
(with Pentex Subversion) or by combat late in the game. Very
difficult to oust, especially if allowed to set up. The absolute
key is to use Magic of the Smith to bring out the Heart as
early in the game as possible. From there you have most tables
covered.
