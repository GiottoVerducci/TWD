Deck Name: Mata Hari Is the Founder
Created by: Adam Hulse and Sonam Adinolf

Description: A Mata Hari + kholo deck (created by Adam Hulse and
Sonam Adinolf). Sonam tried a version of this deck in 2012 Origins
and it was determined that there was not enough payload. So I made
the deck 90 cards and upped the KRC by a lot. The Mask of 1000 Faces
are in there to get around no stealth for the weenie Laibon. Mata masks
and then plays faceless. I didn't make it work so well so that combo
needs some more play to see if worth it.
