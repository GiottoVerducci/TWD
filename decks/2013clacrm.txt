Deck Name: Bad Medicine

Description: It's bad medicine because leeches and Molotov cocktails
are bad for you and will not make you well.

Goal: Antonio and one other guy. There's no reason to get more than two
vampires. Extra pool is for Nephandi.

Two Havens are not enough. Needs at least four. The Rack was probably
stolen from some other deck at some point.

I really like Leech. Only blocked once all day and it was by Jake.

One Conditioning?!? Uh, yeah missing cards. Should be around four.

A few times before when I played this deck I found myself in the
odd position of having enough pool but being out of Nephandi.
Didn't happen this time though.

Delaying Tactics needed!
