Deck Name: 419 911

1GW4 + 1.5 in final

Since most of the times your prey and grandprey make deals for bleeds of one
and it's impossible to eagle's sight everything, I thought it might be worthwhile
to try and prevent your prey from playing at all ... so brainwash, pentex for something
that comes out, a bit of defense and an occasional eagle's sight. Ashur to recover
removed 419, intercept and the small amount of combat. And a last stand that I pulled
off to play in the second game, so your grandprey doesn't get the pool you have on the 419s.
