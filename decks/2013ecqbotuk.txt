Deck Name: Eternal Abuse

Description: Switched Legal's to Intimidation for blood management,
also added 1x covern and jake - reduced Lilyth's to 1x copy as not
really needed now. Deck is quite low on stealth, but permastealth
and corruption counters offset that. Cagliostro is awesome when paired
with Nakhhorheb and the extra discard phase is great to avoid hand jams.
Minimal bounce, but having Keith untapped generally discourages big bleeds.
Added extra Majesties and Mental Mazes for UK meta. Could do with 1x Golconda.
