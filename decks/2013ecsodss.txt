I'm not sure that's the shilmulo tarot is usefull. It could be
replaced by a last stand, but I'm not sure it won't create flow
problems. The rumors is here to get a better flow and also to
play something like a Pentex Subversion before playing Week of
Nigthmares. Consanguinous condemnation is here to tap some minions
your prey keeps untapped to block but also and firstly to deflect.
It could also be defensive by calling it just before a consanguinous
boon if you know that's someone is keeping an untapped vampire to
play delaying tactics. And it's also good to call a domain challenge
just after. If everything is ok, you should be able to put week of
nightmares in turn 6-7 with nearly 12-16 minions.
