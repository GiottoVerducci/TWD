-- 2.5VP in final

Deck Name: Piper Ghoul
Created by: Lukasz Saczek

A deck put up two years ago by Lukasz Saczek for my appearence in Lublin as well.
Since that very event, I had the opportunity to play with it on several occasions.
I decided to use it again for the lack of time required to come up with a new
construction. Personally, I find it mediocre. Or, what is more probable, I simply
cannot drive it the way proper. It was like the fifth tourney I tried War Ghouls,
and this one yielded their very first Game Win. Luckily, in the momentum prim.
