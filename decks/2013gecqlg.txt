Deck Name: "Tai Chi Walking Stick Form" by Miller & his students

Winner of the German ECQ 2013. So far I have played this deck for 6 games.
3 Game Wins and some VPs in the other games. Seems pretty solid deck
construction to me and the cards are very balanced. Miller is important
but not a key vampire that you have to rely uopn.

Fleetness are great in combination with Palla Grande. Always had enough
forward pressure. Art Scams were extremelly important for blood gain and
saved me a lot of times.
