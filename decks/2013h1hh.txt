Dan Apholz

-- 4VP in final

Deck Name: Mr Clean
Created by: Dan Apholz feat Pagan

Modified from an early deck borrowed from David it provides
enough stealth to beat light intercept and voting power to
get votes though. During each round the deck ran into little
in the way of strong intercept or opposing voters. Each game
the initial prey and predator were unable to produce enough
intercept and opposing voters too few to overcome votes or
handle Scalpel Tongues or vote push. Would reconsider adding
Klaus back in as a 4th minion as the deck can easily get a
4th minion into play if given the time.
