Deck Name: Cybele's Curse

Inspired by "Snakes on the Plane" by Ivan Marin-Rivas. This deck, however,
relies more on Maleficia for defensive purposes as well. Rather slow to
build up but can be very effective with time. What I discovered during the
games that putting one Barrenness on one or two key vampires can very much
slow down other decks by limiting their capability to Govern out company,
play Enkil Cog, etc.
