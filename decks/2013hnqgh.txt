Deck Name: Cybele's Curse v2

Inspired by "Snakes on the Plane" by Ivan Marin-Rivas.
This deck, however, relies more on Maleficia for defensive
purpuses as well. Rather slow to build up but can be very
effective with time. What I discovered during the games that
putting one Barrenness on one or two key vampires can very
much slow down other decks by limiting their capability to
Govern out company, play Enkil Cog, etc.
Went up to 90 library cards to include two copies of sense the
sin for solid ousting power and three dreams for better cards
flow. Both turned out to be a good idea - thanx to Martin Major.
