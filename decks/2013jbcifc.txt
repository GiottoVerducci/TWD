Deck Name: The 7th Tradition: Parity Shift

This was one hairy final. I was down to 1 pool like 3 times.
I ended up killing my prey with a shift and finished off my grand
prey by Justicar Retributioning his main vamp. If I ran this
again, I'd definitely run 4 shifts and 4 boons instead.
Keep on bleedin.
Peace
