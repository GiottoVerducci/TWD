Deck Name: Angelica Ascendant

Description: It won a tournament, but can it win a game?
Angelica's special means that Ascendances can be used for
intercept as well as pool gain. She gets Eternal Vigilance
and a .44 Magnum and blocks. Anson provides support, cycling
masters faster and providing Angelica with blood from the
Fifth Tradition. Fish for weenies, stealth bleed or bruise
bleed for the VP.

I felt perpetually short on bleed during the tournament,
and after having written out the decklist, I see that I
had fewer bleed cards than I thought. At minimum, one
Shroud of Night should be switched for a Threats. One of
the Ascendances probably should be changed to a Pentex
Subversion for contesting or lunging, but Pentex is less
prevalent in L.A. than in other places.
