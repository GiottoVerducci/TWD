Deck Name: Draba Jack

Based on Ference Vasadi's Ravnos Deck
Resilient Deck that just refused to die. In the finals I
had to play the Week of Nightmares much earlier than I would
have liked. Ousted my prey but within a few turns the Week
of Nightmares counters would all expire and slam my vamps.
Took the opportunity to rearrange my blood a bit via Vessel
and then blew up the Week on my own turn so that I could
control things a bit. By ordering those effects I saved one
vamp and was able to hold on for the victory.
