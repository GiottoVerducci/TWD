Deck Name: Imbued nerds no longer worship Satan

Description: I've been playing variations of this same deck
since my 2007 "Twist with Conviction".

Tournaments are Serious Business, so my Imbued have ditched
their wacky infernal friends (with their Maleficia/Evil Eye
or Striga/Scobax module). They still love to hack computers
though, since that seriously speeds up their stealth bleeding.

Things I would change:
- Remove all but one On the Qui Vive.
- Wendell Delburton was useless. I forgot to take him out
after reducing the number of Weighted Walking Sticks by a lot.
- Suddens or Washes would be nice.
