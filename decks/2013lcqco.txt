Deck Name: Girls in the Pentex(TM) boardroom

3gw
Description: I got the original idea from Anders LÃ¶f. He was running it
with Nana and Ashur rush combat without reaction cards. I decided that I
wanted to run it with Aksinya with reactions instead. The decks are quite
different but the idea with high amount of Pentex(TM) works kinda the same.
