Deck Name: Modern Daughters

Description: "A liitle bit of this, a little bit of that... I missed
one or two Conductors for the deck, never used the Reinforcements,
having all the vampires out all rounds, Bane+ Phantom + stealth are
sweet against blockers, definitely there is space for 1-2 additional
Siren's Lure."
