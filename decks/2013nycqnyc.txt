Deck Name: Terrifying Politics

Description: New York City Qualifier Tournament Deck Winner 2013
A Tzimisce Vote deck. A nice thing is that when going against them,
you never know what you are facing. Bounce? Combat? Bleed? I knew
that i would be seeing some Cam vote decks in there so Private
Audience and Fear of Mekhet were a must. Purchase Pact barely
made the cut but I figured with Radu I should try it. It even
works in torpor! And instead of a variety of combat, I went back
to good ole' agg + Rötschreck.
