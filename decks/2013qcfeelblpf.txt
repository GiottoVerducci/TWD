Deck Name: Tribute to Denis "Richter" who ousted me with a similar deck.

Finished during the evening before the event, at 2AM.
I realized it was missing some key cards during the rounds.

Crypt comments: With no crypt acceleration, Murat is
likely to be the best vampire of the crypt. That Tusk
could become a Murat.

There is no crypt accelerator. Well, there should probably, but not as master cards

That's where the crypt acceleration should be. Some Fourth trads could only help. ShreckNET is also sort of mandatory here...

Perhaps one or two Freak Drives?

A couple of extra Parity Shifts and some better votes would simply make the deck better. Neonate Breach, Banishment,
