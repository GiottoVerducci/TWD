Deck Name: Khazar's Diary deck ripped from TWDA
Created by: Not Chris Shorb

Played at the San Jose Qualifier Dec 28, 2013.
I discarded Sudario without ever playing it. For my playstyle, I couldn't
ever see discarding 3 cards from my hand at random...
I'd probably sub in 1 Call Hungry Dead, 1 Shroudsight, 1 Shroud Mastery,
2 Spiritual Intervention. But that's because I'm a toolbox-head at heart.
Khazar's never kicked off - sitting between two wall decks my first game and
one of the 2 walls again my 2nd game hosed me pretty hard.
Anarch Converts saved me in both preliminary games - one of the walls was using
Anarch Revolt to do pool damage...

Finals - I used my predator's lunge to deflect to my prey and wear his defenses down.
A Pentex on his remaining vampire allowed me to oust. We timed out 2 minutes 15 seconds
later. That gave me the only VP at the table...
