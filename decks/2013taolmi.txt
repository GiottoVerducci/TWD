-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Guillaume for rent
Created by: thelonius_reloaded

Description: It's a toolbox recursive deck, with some situational strong
defense and a light necrobleed module to oust. Extremely valuable had been
the 2 Trochomancy to take care of other recursive decks, and the combo
Revelations/Precision to get rid of a double Deflection in my prey's hand.
Sacre Coeur never been much useful due to the lack of ally deck, but I will
keep it. Nicomedes is AMAZING when you have 11/12 cards in hand, and
Sennadurek skill has often been underestimated, giving me full acces to
almost all table's hand.
