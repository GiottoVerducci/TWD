-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Miller Time

This is one of the first decks I made. It was very rewarding to finally
win a tournament with it. As the Boston VTES group will tell you, I'm
the Miller guy. This deck has undergone an evolution from a committed
intercept combat deck, to a bleed deck emphasizing Palla Grande and a
combat package to discourage blocking. Focus on high efficiency permanents
allows the deck to mostly focus on reactions and combat. If you replicate
this deck make sure to spread the damage masters and bow amongst your
minions so other players don't want to block them. Punching with Miller
for 4 is fun, but doesn't get you GWs.
