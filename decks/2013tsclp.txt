Deck Name: Guedado Ghouls

Description: This deck is designed to bring out War Ghouls at extra
speed - cutting the deck size to 50 and using D'habi revenants does
the trick nicely, plus the revenants make perfect "meat" for corrupt
constructs later on. Ideally you should have 3-4 minions on turn 3,
which is not uncommon. Guedado is a true star here, giving you access
to the Powerbase, Forgotten Labyrinths and of course the Strange day,
which literally saved the day many times. Some credit goes to Szewski
for his advices before playing my 1st tournament with this deck. Thanks mate.
