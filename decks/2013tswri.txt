Deck Name: Cock Robin Espionage Network

(Special thanks to Drace Zhan for introducing me to Alonzo
Guillen as an addition to the crypt)
The purpose of this Cock Robin/Deep Song/Enkil Cog iteration is
to greatly boost that deck archetype's versatility by taking
advantage of the powerful support abilities of Shahid and Alonzo
Guillen. Extra hand size/hand building combined with being able
to see predator/prey hands is the reason I call it the espionage
network because like good secret service networks in the world the
deck can see exactly what its target is doing and act accordingly.
It can be played in a variety of ways depending on the table.
