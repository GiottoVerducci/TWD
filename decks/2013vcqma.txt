Deck Name: Brujah Mass Debate

Description: Deck designed to get weenies princes out quick, parity's for
pool damage/gain which also gives strong deal making power. Brujah Debates
for defence/offence, hopefully making prey/predator thinking twice before
blocking. Has a some combat so you hopefully don't get totally pole-axed
when table starts working together to remove Debates (which happens).
Immortal Grapples are there to keep other decks that pack strike combat/dodge
decks (and no prevention) nervous about blocking, & Blood Dolls in there to
reduce your pool if prey is staying under Parity Shift range, and for
blood/pool management. Carthage Remembered + computer hacking worked well
in one game. Second Tradition for block defence worked well.

Card's I'd take out: Well-Aimed Car (placed in there for shits & giggles,
never got to use), would replace for Stunt Cycle or Sew Lid. Would take out
1 Pulled Fang and replace with 1 Disarm (grappled and disarmed Anneke after
she blocked cross table as she kept voted down most of what I did-which
is understandable).

Possible additions: Another Dreams of the Sphinx, Smiling Jack,
Specialization, Parthenon (I could not find any I owned otherwise
on the day I would have had 3-4 in deck).
