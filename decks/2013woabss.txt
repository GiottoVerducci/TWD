Deck Name: Unnamed cruising at Baltic Sea

Description: Unnamed deck using Maleficia; Greater Curses for
gaining more pool and slowing down combat decks, evil eyes
canceling and psalms to get bleeds in right address. Deck needs
some slimming down and maybe some Villeins as vampires where in
near full capacity in many games I played in boat and EC. Thanks
for building tips (and few borrowed cards) for Toni Karjalainen.
