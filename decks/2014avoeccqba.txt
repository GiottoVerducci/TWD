Ventrue Stickmen
This one is based on Hugh's winning deck, he convinced me that the Ventrue Stickmen
were stronger than the !Ventrue Grinder. Added a few ally specific cards,
never needed the force of personality other than 1 game when I never drew either,
the entrancement was gold though. Glad Hugh put forth a compelling case for the Ventrue
since Neighbour John was everywhere and I would have been contesting in every game if I
had gone that way!
