Deck Name: (2014) Replay Value

Description: This deck is about as toolboxy as I get.
Minion text offers on-demand bleed and Orlando almost ensures votelock,
so the deck is often able make opportunistic moves.

The finals saw 4 of the 5 players in potentially winning positions as the clock wore down.
This created incentive for an unusual number of cross-table rescues, allowing me to survive
Hugh's relentless Ahrimane and Ossian rushing. I got a lucky VP in the end for a win as high seed.

I got Rafael in my opening crypt 3 of the 4 games, which had to contribute to success. The crypt might benefit from one more copy, dropping Victor.
