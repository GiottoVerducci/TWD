Deck Name: Memantine Therapy (2014)

Description: The second concept from the Art of Memory deck series. I had optimized
the library a week before the tournament, but I musy have mashed the culls back in with
the keepers by mistake. The deck still functioned acceptably, but it would benefit from
squeezing out 6-8 cards to get the 1-offs more frequently.

A good case could be made to remove the 2 weenies in favor of additional copies of Appius and Saul.

I saw either ally-based or location-rich opponents in every round. Having access to such efficient recursion for the theft cards was a real advantage.

The Seductions should probably be removed.
