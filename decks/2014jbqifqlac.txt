-- 1.5VP in final

Deck Name: Steve Coombs Memorial

Egothha has always been one of my favorite vampires. When I learned that the model for his portrait passed away, I built this deck in his honor.

How to play: Villein, Perfectionist, and Restoration to keep your pool total high. Tap and bleed when the time is right! Jar the Soul, Telepathic Misdirection, and plain old "get blocked, S:CE, Freak Drive" all provide plenty of opportunities to lunge.

The incidental titles help get the support of political decks on the table. The 9-caps have each have +1 bleed which is good but not required. Note that Under my Skin is playable by most of the vampires in the crypt, and is quite a surprise!
