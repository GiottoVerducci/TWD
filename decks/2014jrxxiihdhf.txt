Title: Grumpy Cat
Otso Saariluoma's deck with minor modifications (without checking I think
I just added two Wider Views). Heh, I thought I had replaced two
Freak Drives/Forced Marches with Instantaneous Transformations but noticed
just prior to the tournament that I had only set the removed cards aside but
hasn't added the prints to the sleeves and since I didn't have color prints
with me decided to skip this modification. Silly me... Also, I think I've probably
loaned a Dreams of the Sphinx (=third) from the deck to another one and haven't replaced it.
