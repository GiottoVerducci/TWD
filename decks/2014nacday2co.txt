-- 3VP in final

Description: It's a vote deck with a lot of toolbox, defense, and agg strikes.
Notes:
I originally had built a tournament-level Terrifisto deck, and I also had a
Lambach deck in my casual deck supply (which used goofy stuff like Deploy the Hand).
I played the Terrifisto deck at the LCQ #1, and I found it to be quite
underwhelming. So I started a deck retrofit the morning of the tournament,
using the Lambach crypt, and the Terrifisto library. Removing ~8 fortitude cards from
the Terrifisto deck gave me some creative space to work with.

Even for a crypt that has great access to untap and intercept
effects, putting an Under Siege on the table is really powerful. I simply get
the freedom to tap out and my predator knows I have untap/intercept sitting on
the table. Add Lambach's agg threat on top of that.

If he gets stolen, he can trash the Black Forest Base. I know
it's a bit corner case, but you do have to watch out for it. Otherwise you're
going to endure some serious gloating when someone actually pulls it off.

It's been said before, but it's worth repeating:
This card is amazingly good and other players don't even see how you're building
the perfect hand at the start of your turn. This card directly got me the winning
vp, as I drew into two Changelings at just the right time.

I like this card, but it's very hard to remember to use it
in every untap phase (including your own) For some reason I had particular trouble
remembering to use it in my prey's untap phase.

This is a great card, but I'm always hesitant to add it
to decks because it adds table chatter. If you use it, be prepared for the
cross-table begging and have a ready yes/no answer prepared so it doesn't
stall the game.

1x Fiendish Tongue -- Could probably be a Deep Song, in case you want to rush. The untap from Tongue isn't really needed given all the untap/wakes in the deck.

Action Modifier (14)
1x Bribes
4x Changeling
1x Conditioning
1x Crocodile's Tongue

3x Telepathic Vote Counting

Action Modifier/Combat (1)
1x Plasmic Form

Reaction (27)
1x Cardinal Sin: Insubordination -- Never got to pull it off in the tournament, but I'd still keep it in the deck. I was anticipating more Sabbat decks using Danse Macabre cards.
