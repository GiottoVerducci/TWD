Deck Name: Chapel Hard By

Not a designated tournament deck. Unlike my designated tournament decks,
actually takes actions. For a tournament, would have junked it up with
good cards, like six Conceals. There is a required local name for this
deck, but I'm not one to stir controversy. This deck could have had a
variety of cool names. It's really all a matter of the key cards. Take
away the Creation Rites, Obfuscate, and Computer Hackings and what do
you have? Death to unbelievers. Once upon a time, once when you rhyme,
there were those who lacked faith. True, truth is not an issue. Fleeing,
though, accomplishes nothing. Health comes from drinking.
