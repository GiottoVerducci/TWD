Deck Name: Just Say NO
Created by: Stefan Ferenci, slightly modified by Miguel A. Ripoll

Description: I wanted to remember old times, so I tried to keep the deck as similar
as possible with Stefan's deck to see how it could work nowadays (the only additions
are Eyes of Argus and Read the Winds). In this deck, you should almost never use
Eyes of Argus for intercept, but as extra untaps. The deck has some problems, mainly
it's very master heavy, and lacks permanent intercept. Sometimes it's difficult to
combine Breath of the Dragon and they can clog your hand. But it is still a sturdy deck,
good against fatties and with enough ousting power.
