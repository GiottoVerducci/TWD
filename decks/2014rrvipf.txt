-- 2.5vp in final

Deck Name: MiamMiam
Created by: Mouk another french player for 90% a little beat modify by myself.

Always the same mecanic, bring Malgo out first, then bring Fanchon out with Malgo power.
Then get the card you need with Fanchon special. You get easily 11 votes, but if you
do not get the majority, do not hesitate to block and amaranth cross table to ansure your majority.
You have pb with ally deck, but you can manage most of the combat deck, vote and SB deck.
