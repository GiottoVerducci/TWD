Winning Deck List: Two trick pony
This deck uses Pariah as a thug, with PRO pot combat and a tiny splash of Anarch tech.
Since that is such a terrible idea, it also has a Henry Twister module grafted on, so it can actually win games.
These two synergise very well, with Pariah also working to cycle through masters, (even after he gets smashed into torpor).

NOTE: I'd prefer 4/4/4 with Anarch Convert (or 6/6/6 for flavour), but I do not own any.

Note: these are all Sudden Reversal magnets. I never got more than 2 media locations into play.

NOTE: out of 4 games, I only got Mr Winthrop once, and no Sport Bike ever. Everyone knows Henry too well, and saves their intercept. A wise player would rather be grappled and punched for 5 than let Henry get set up.
