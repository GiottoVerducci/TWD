-- 1.5VP in final

Deck Name: Night of the 13 Living Dead

A classical Shambleed deck, but as I hadn't played for a very long time I stuck to what I knew (and liked) best.

Guilhem Marranes had to drop from the finals, he had destroyed everything in rounds with his Assamite Black Hand so I was very happy not to see him there lol. He would probably have won.
