Deck Name: Three Girls and their Masters

Shout goes out to Randalf Rudsdam (aka. the loud, drunken Swede) who played a Talbot/Aksinya deck about 3 years ago at Gothcon in Sweden. I don't know the content of his deck, but it got me started on this one.
The deck has some pretty crazy card flow which is why it has so many cards. I decked myself 3 times at this weekend's two tournaments even after triggering Ashur's, and generally end every game with very few cards left.
