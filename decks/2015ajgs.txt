Deck Name: Nergal Dream Team

Nergal s&b with some Infernal Servitors and Dream Worlds to spread out the bleeds. In one of the prelims Nergal was the sixth vampire down my crypt,
in the other two Nergal was rushed to torpor and graverobbed. I managed to squeeze out a GW in one of the games nevertheless and got to the finals
to race against Adam's Kiasyd bleed around the table. In the heads-up against Kim's wallish !Gangrel I managed to get just enough stealth to win the finals.
MVP cards of the tournament were: Veneficti, Learjet, Infernal Servitors and ADV-Nergal's special.
