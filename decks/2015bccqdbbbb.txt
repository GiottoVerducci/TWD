Deck Name: VENI VIDI VICI (Malkavian Princes)

Description: The event turned out to be a very nice one, with many players attending (for current standards) thanks to a big Italian delegation, who came, saw, and conquered
The final was a quick and dirty affair, with Martin's fearsome Dracon deck quickly annihilated by a Saturday Night Special / Dragon Breath Rounds combo pulled out by Bram.
After Martin was ousted in about 20 minutes, the situation looked quite unstable, until Danilo killed everyone else at the table with an Ancilla Empowerment, winning the tournament with 2 VP in final (with 1 VP for Bram, Tom and Bart).
