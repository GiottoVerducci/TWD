Deck Name: [KIA] Kiasyd 66 cards

The deck is just big enough to get you through the table.
1st game: 3vp. My third vp was just when I decked out with 6 minutes left on the clock. Most of my minions were torpored, witouth cards my last one soon joined them and all 4 got eaten.
2nd game: 0vp. Beast rush deck in my back. My deck can't cope with rush potence torn grapple blur.
3rd game: 3vp. a crucial seduction on anneke allowed my first oust. My prey and predator were contesting a pentex for the whole game. Martin's presence bleeder got through the wakes of anneke anson after which I took the table.

Final: setite corrupt vote -> nosferatu vote -> gangrel royalty -> me kiasyd sb -> presence bleed.
My opening crypt at this table was perfect. I had pheridima(8 bishop) and omme (7 priscus) 4 transfers to start with and a govern.
Me and the nosferatu had votelock over my predator which allowed me to keep the gangrel alive but severely damaged and a little threat. I got through the presence deck, at which point the table started to collapse. The nosferatu died soon after. Giving me, the stealth bleed deck votelock over the table. I went from 14 to 4 pool in a single turn, allowing myself to get parity shifted for my predators benefit, pentexing xaviar(who downgraded to prince) influencing a new minion and paying pheridima to get an untapped minion.

I delayed the reckless agitation from the setites who were about to backoust me.
Then my predator did a bleed of 1 with form of mist (3 pool left) he tried to cycle hard to find his kine resources contested , luckily he failed to find it.
My prey had 3 pool left, my predator 7.
My prey bounces the first govern, bounces the second govern. I go for a third and luckily that's all he had. Bleed for 1 with a seduction to win the game.
