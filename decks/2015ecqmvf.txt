Deck Name: Bibliodèque [9] He-who-shall-not-be-named (Baali stealth/bleed)
Created by: Orian TTC Gissler with help from Derjudge, Alkardil, Tim on a decklist from Thomas Gibson

The Bibliodèque (http://www.veknfrance.com/viewforum.php?f=49) is a French project made of 99 decklists (and designed to welcome more in the future hopefully) based on Tournament winning Decklists or Archetypes,
to help people building decks for their casual play or tournaments, and ultimately print those decks in proxy to have a library of decks available for their playgroup.
Tweaks for the tournament were made only to adapt my playstyle and the time limit finals.
-1 Secure haven +1 Perfectionist
-1 Lost in crowds +1 Life boon
During all the tournament, I was thinking I should have played more Flurry of action. For the rest, everything is probably fine as it is. Many good tricks in the deck.
