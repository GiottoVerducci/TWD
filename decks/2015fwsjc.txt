Deck Name: Giovanni mini powerbleed with goods.

Lex Pike wins the gold star for putting Funeral Wake into the TWDA in a tournament by the same name! I don't know if that has ever been done before, especially within days of the cards becoming tournament legal.

Also new to the TWDA: Enzo Adv, Soul Feasting


Giovanni is one of my favorite clans. A little bits of goods for different things. Been playing the “Shroud Mastery” angle a bit. Shroud Mastery Card is cool, but not good enough in the sense that it becomes a dead card in your hand if you do not have a wraith card in your hand or in play. Toolboxish mini powerbleed with some vote defense tech.

Wish there is another stealth package, maybe anarch rail road tech. I keep having visions of one card vs my stealth package like the Bowl of Convergence, Eyes of Argus, ect…would stop/slow down this deck.
Do need to remove/replace Talbot's Chainsaw - all three rounds Ambrosius or Tye Cooper either got stolen or destroyed. I did have the pleasure to see Ambrosius got Pentex Subversion for the first time.
