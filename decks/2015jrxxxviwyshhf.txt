Deck Name: Tryphosa parties like it's '94

Description: During the tournament someone pointed out to me that this is like
a Malk 94 deck but with a different crypt. Which is rather correct but I didn't
realize it when building it (I don't own old Malks, so the whole Aus Dom Obf
thing isn't something I've done before). Mental Maze can worth it over Obedience
during these days of ally aggression so I went with a mix.
