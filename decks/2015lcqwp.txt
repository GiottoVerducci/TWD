EC 2015 - Last Chance Qualifier
Warsaw, Poland
August 28th 2015
74 players

I believe this is the list I won Last Chance with. Maybe someone from the EC organizers can check that the
tournament details and the decklist are correct (as I already disassembled the deck back in the EC and
there's no list other than the one I gave to judges)?

The deck itself has the usual suspects with AUS PRE. It is inspired by a similiar deck popularized by
Martin Weinmeyer's EC win back in 2009 - although with higher caps, more Auspex and lacking Fortitude and
Daring the Dawns. This version has problems with dedicated blockers and stealth vote, but otherwise has
proven to be quite resilient with lots of reactions and combat ends, which gives the flexibility to alter
your tempo and possibly wait for an opportunity to present itself.

In the preliminary rounds I really would have needed Darings against my ani pro prey. In the second round
I got lucky as Kim was one card short of running away with the game, which would have costed me the spot
in the finals. And I got lucky again in the finals drawing half of my combat ends in the first quarter of
the library against Pascal's Enkidu - but some luck is obviously needed in this game. In the heads-up
against Noora's Unnamed the deck transformed into a half-decent block deck.
