Deck Name: Laying the Foundation

Bring out Batsheva, Founders of the Ebony Kingdom and tool up, then bleed out your prey. Spending only about 10 pool on minions helps provide the buffer that you need to survive against bleeds or votes that you can't yet block. The Deep Song is mainly used for bleed, but you can rush and drunk someone or rush/tap and Majesty to send in bleeds.

He who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building.
Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, The Prince
