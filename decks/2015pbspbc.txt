Deck Name: Guillaume's Surprise

Description: Guillaume Giovanni gets a bunch of Storage Annexes, in which he stores a killer hand
of cryptic-rider-chained political actions that can destroy the table in a single turn, to be kicked
off by Día de los Muertos. Wait for the right moment, then... surprise!

This is a first-draft, untested deck that got lucky in a small qualifier. It successfully blew up
a table in one preliminary round, and scraped a last-minute oust in the final for a win with 1.5VP.
That said, it might eventually make a viable deck.

Changes to make: See Updated Kiasyd Version at www.secretlibrary.info/index.php?deck=view&id=20636 . It includes better vamps, better stealth and some vote defense, which were the major aspects needed.
