Deck Name: Women in chains

Description: An evolution of my Gangrel Dominate deck, mixed with my Gang of Fur deck (with no Dominate at all)
and a big deal of inspiration from Martin Weinmayer's deck. Ingrid Rossler is very important since it's probably
the first vampire you'll bring out in order to play Parity Shift and to accelerate the influence of the other vampires.
