Deck Name: It's a friendly deck, don't trust the setites
Created by: Randal Rudstam

When the Unaligned set was release I was very interested in some of the new FoS cards, I wanted to play reckless and parity shift in the same deck.
After some time and much work on the deck, me and my good friend Stefan Karlsson, who also was working on a similar deck, built this deck, minor differences,
this became me latest version. Some changes are about to happen.
Kemintiris abilities led to two big things in the final. One she was able to rush Lucinde, Alastor and Arika and use Serpents numbing kiss to "mind numb" them.
Also in the heads up with the same deck the so called "venture Justicar" used the extra bleed she gets against Venture to great effect.
