-- 1.5VP in final

Deck Name: The feel of the rod

Description: Based on David Durans "I Have a Stick" from Camarilla Conclave 2014. I wanted to play princes with sticks, but not my usual one, so I took David's deck and made some random tweaks. I switched 2 Vessel for 2 Villein, 4 Public Trust for Governs, 1 Parity Shift for 1 Anarchist Uprising, 1 Foreshadowing for 1 Conditioning, 2 Redirection for 2 Deflectioning, 2 WWEF for 2 Second Traditions, 4 Taste of Vitae for 2 Soak and 2 Weighted Walking Stick. Switched Joseph D for extra Mustafa. I see now that the alternations can be discussed, and there are still much room for improvement, but it worked out fine at the tournament:)
