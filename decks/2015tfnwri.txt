Deck Name: Jen Friday TempleCon 2015

The deck worked well when it got going, but getting going from the #2 position at a table was tough. After playing it more, I'd put in a second Secure Haven, remove Honor the Elders for another damaging vote (not enough big vamps out to make it worth while) and change out at least one True Love's Face for Voter Captivation - the deck needs bloat and that (and Villein) are all it has. Mundane was really helpful when I drew it, and I'd probably swap one of the Telepathic Misdirection or Counters for another Majesty. Finally, Drozodny is amazing, if I didn't need votes, he beat Stavros every time.
