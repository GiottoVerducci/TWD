Deck Name: Tzimmy Wall

Description: What if Brum did a Tzimmy Wall?
Typical Tzimisce Wall with my own analysis from the concept, that was created while writing a blog post about errors I see in wall building.

I have no idea why people don't use Vykos ADV as the main vampire in any tzimmy wall. He gives you so many options, like being able to use more Master cards, having one or two silver bullets, etc.

Maybe one less Dreams and one more Guardian Angel. It's fun to have multiple Lodins. And saving blood on Tzimmies is a good thing.
-- Papillon is great here. It clearly was a though on the building of the crypt, since I already would have Vykos Adv.
-- Oddly enough I don't think I need Pentex.

Non arrogant wall.

Ivory Bow is going to leave if I increase Guardian Angels. It is only a win more card.

Odd pick of cards, yes?
-- I don't need Enhanced Senses. Deflecting or canceling referendums is more card effective and beneficial.
-- Everything else is built to protect Smiling Jacks.
-- Wall without ousting power are one of the evils of this World.

Vykos allows for extras in some places.
-- Blood of Acid is good against many things. This pack is perfect for me.
