Deck Name: Cracked Egg

Description: Only 11 caps for bonus points. 6x Eagle's Sights to have some table presence
and to stop prey running away with the game. 2x Heart of Cheating to ensure you can magic
it and other equipment late game. Dragonbound works really well as a finisher with minimal
negative effect. Based on a deck by Martin Schumacher.
