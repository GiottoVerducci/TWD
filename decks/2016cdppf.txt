Vincent Ripoll

-- 2vp in final

Deck Name: Princess Pitch

Description: After going back and forth between versions with or without Dominate, with or without Villein+Perfectionist,
I finally tried the highly aggressive way of doing things: no Deflection, 2 more Shattering Crescendos and Daring the Dawn
to ensure the delivery. The deck is a bit like a weenie Potence when having an aggressive predator, but with
even less defense considering the intercept problems of the Daughters. Backousting IS an option because there is
very little pool gain (Legal, Wider View and Powerbase if you're lucky to draw it).
The "stealth" module (Daring the Dawn, Missing Voice, Siren's Lure, Paris Opera House and Virtuosa) works extremely well,
even against heavy blocker. Just be sure to use the Daring wisely so you send the blocking minions to torpor.
