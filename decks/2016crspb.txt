-- 4VP in final

Deck Name: Captain Spaulding strikes again!

Description: Try to maximize handsize, so all needed cards will be on hand for the best profit.
Could have more deep songs instead of governs, almost all of them were used for oust
instead of bloat/crypt acceleration. Combat tech was sharp.
