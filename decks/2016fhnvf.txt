Niina Lindroos

-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Velvet vote

Description: A deck that I made in 2015 inspired by the new set. Played it first time at
Finnish ECQ 2015 (Ropecon) and made a few tweaks based on that tournament for this second go.

Final table: Henri (Animalism bleed/bock toolbox?) > Lauri (Nergal Powerbleed) > Timo (Arika votes + bleed) > Mikko H. (Arika Mind Rape + bleed + vote) > Niina (New Setite Voter)
Niina 3vp
Lauri 2vp
Nice games overall.. The Finals went so that Timo and Mikko contested Arika, and I managed to oust TImo, after that Mikko's Arika played Mind Rape on my Nergal, but I stil managed to oust him, and after that Henri rushed and torporized my nergal with aggro poke, and then diaplerized, after that we played a long waiting game, where Niina tried to oust Henri and he tried to oust me... finaly about 10 minutes left in game Niina got the upperhand and managed to oust both of us just five mintues to the time. Congrats to Niina on her first tournament win.

(There are 2 Zillah's Valley because I have not enough Eternals of Sirius.)
