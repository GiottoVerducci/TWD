-- 5VP in final

Deck Name: What We Do In the Shadows

Description: Black Hand tap-and-bleed. In this tournament, I rarely drew any of the tapping tech (except Nocturn Theater, but see below), and so it ended up playing as bleed-and-bleed instead. I got 13 of the 14 possible VPs available to me, though, so I can't complain too much.

Theoretically good tech which I didn't get to use includes using Tattoo Signal and the bleed equipment to do some light Darby Dancing, using Tangle Atropos' Hand with the bleed equipment to safely eliminate bleed bounce and then bleed again with the same vampire, and being able to boast that you played a Lasombra bleed deck without ever adding stealth to a bleed action.

Thanks to Darby and Hugh for transcontinental and trans-Atlantic deck advice, to Karl Schaefer for lending me the Shrouds of Absence, and to Mark Loughman for breaking down the local metagame before the tournament.

could use a Wider View or two and some Sudden Reversals, but I didn't know what to cull for them

Library (76 cards)
Master (14; 1 trifle)
2x Anarch Troublemaker
1x Coven, The
1x Elysian Fields
1x Giant's Blood
2x Jake Washington
1x Nocturn Theater -- last minute addition, replacing a third Remover; too expensive and burnable to be useful, so pull it and put the third Remover back in
1x Pentex(TM) Subversion
1x Political Hunting Ground
2x Remover
1x Watchtower: Four Ride Forth
1x Weeping Stone -- I drew this early in all three games, and always hesitated to play it due to its cost, but it was pivotal in every game

Action (14)
11x Govern the Unaligned
3x Tattoo Signal

Ally (4)
4x Nocturn -- included to defend against rushes, but there was less rush combat than I'd feared and I ended up just bleeding with them

Equipment (4)
1x Codex of the Edenic Groundskeepers
1x Gran Madre di Dio, Italy
1x Guarded Rubrics
1x Zaire River Ferry

Action Modifier (24)
3x Art of Memory, The -- highly underrated card
2x Change of Target
5x Conditioning
3x Foreshadowing Destruction
2x Seduction
2x Shadow Play
3x Shroud of Absence
2x Shroud of Night
2x Tangle Atropos' Hand -- in theory, these are amazing with the bleed equipment; in practice, I'll probably forget to make sure that the equipment is on the guys in my crypt who have Potence, and I didn't need any of them to win any of my games in this tournament, so they can probably go

Reaction (14)
5x Deflection

3x On the Qui Vive
2x Redirection
2x Wake with Evening's Freshness
