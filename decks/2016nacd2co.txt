Deck Name: [2016 Origins] Six Demon Bag

-- GW2.5 + 0 + GW2.5 + 3VP in final

Description: Deceivingly robust unnamed bleed deck. Plinks away while maintaining a decent pool buffer, then tends to have unexpectedly large turns (often with a pair of Infernal Servitors back-to-back). I'm still shocked at how well this deck holds up in tournament play.
Finalists: Mark Loughman (Lasombra Nocturn Bleed) --> Sonam Adinolf (Spirit Marionette + DOM Tap/Bleed) --> Will Kristoff (Alonzo Petrodon Toolbox) --> Adam Hulse (Ishtarri Multiaction) -- Darby Keeney (unnamed Bleed)

If one wanted to make modifications to the library, the Coven would be a very worthwhile inclusion and 1-2 Forms of Mist might be worth considering. Other than that, it seems to handle pretty consistently..
