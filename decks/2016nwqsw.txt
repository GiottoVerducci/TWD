-- 0.5VP in final

Deck Name: Northwest Qualifier 2016: Woke

Description: Weenie animalism wall with a splash of deflection and conditioning for the oust.

Final table: Kelly (baali,striga, mmpa) > John (weenie animalism wall) > Kevin (brandywine madness network) > Darby (reply value: large cap vote and bleed) > Brian (large cap lasombra vote and bleed).

The qualifier went as well as it could have taking into account that most games went to time and only 2 players had a GW going into the final round. We spent some time discussing the cause of this after the tournament and this is what we determined.
-A few players were running lots of votes (Darby and Brian particularly) and butting heads on each referendum. We saw vote cancelling and multiplying tech and several players were using multiple copies of Delaying Tactics.
-Scobax and bleed reduction both had a hand in keeping counters on the table.
-Most players were holding deflections and the most aggressive decks had huge bleed potential at stealth, so everyone was playing very cautiously while trying to find an opportunity to go forward.

In the end, we had a lot of fun and pick-up games on Friday and Sunday.
Thank you to everyone that came out for this and especially to those that traveled from out of state.
