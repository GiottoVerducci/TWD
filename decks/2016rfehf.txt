Deck Name: Rose of the Devil's Garden

Description: Ropecon 2016 Finnish ECQ winner.

Due to having zero time to actually build anything new I had to resort to using an old deck
that had scored me one win previously (Justicar Retribution XXII on Jan 26th 2014), just added
the two missing Instantaneous Transformations (and forgot about the 3rd Dreams...).

The deck is Otso Saariluoma's winning deck (Praxis Seizure XLV from Nov 30th 2008) with just
few very minor tweaks so praise should go in his direction.

The finals was a weird one, starting off with accidental Anarch Convert contesting, which probably ended up
hampering Mikko ever so slightly and probably slowing Lasse down a bit, although not as much as missing
Nizzam in the opening crypt though. With Muazizotronic Mikko ran through his deck merely acquiring my
Chandler and Nora's Unnamed -the latter took the pressure off my back. I don't recall even Mikko protesting
me ousting him and thus removing Pain in the Rearside #1 (aka Tablethreat) from the table soon after Timo
Banished Muaziz. At this point Lasse and Noora were in more or less damaged goods while Timo also was in the
same situation as I was; a player with hardly any or no pressure. Soon Noora was ousted. I was a bit worried
for a while about losing vote battle to Timo but the arrival of Genevieve (and removal of Noora's Arishat with
her mistress) fixed that. Then it was, luckily, just the matter of bleeding/voting in consistent manner with
enough stealth all the while avoiding the temptation of going to Archonable range. Mainly I have Mikko to
thank for my victory, he built the runway from himself and Lasse and also secured my rear by tripping Noora.
