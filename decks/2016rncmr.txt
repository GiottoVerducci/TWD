Deck Name: You don't need Villeins to play high caps

Description: Here in Russia we got serious card availability problem, so to not discourage few new players we have,
I decided to limit use of "rare" cards in a decks. It is hard, we have to do something with it:)
So obviously to maximize performance you have to switch crypt for AAA, minion taps for Villeins, fun trifles for acceleration
and add one politic, Flurry of Action, Croc Tongue and Majesty.
NB - in general you have to play FoA on inferior.
