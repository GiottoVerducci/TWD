-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Full pool

I asked to winner player, and he doesn't use Villen just because he doesn't have. He try to compensate using cards that give to him more MPAs.
He was using the Golconda only against his prey, forcing to burn vampire with rush or making burn pool.
I saw that was not a equilibrate deck, however he got to go to final in first place and the positions were favorable to him. His first prey was an imnbued,
so the intercept was enough and he had his second prey (Lasombra) with just three pool and used Pentex Subversion.
The last players were Gangrel with Auspex (Wall) and he use Life Boon to got his last VP.
It was more strategy than effective cards.
