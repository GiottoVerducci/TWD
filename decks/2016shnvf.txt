Jari 1vp
Lauri 1vp

Again very nice attendance, we decided before tournament to play only 2 rounds and Final. Very nice weather out and Finland was playing WC Ice Hockey semi-finals agaisnt Russia, so with just 10 players we took just 2 preliminary rounds and then finals.

The finals started that I (Lauri) played crosstable banishment on Muaziz and then nxt turn Chameleon steal on it, to get the table threat of that basically ruined my game on second round, luckily I did get to the finals with just 2vps from first round, though with dice against Matti, who had same vps and also same tp. As fifth seed I had to go aggressively after that ahead, but Teemu managed to oust both me and Jari on same turn after he had already ousted Mikko, rather easy prey without Muaziz. and won the tournament then with his 3 vps. Congrats to Teemu for returning from torpor and again winning tournament..
