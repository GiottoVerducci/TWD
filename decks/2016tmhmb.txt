-- 4VP in final

Deck Name: Feminazis

Muricia or Effie must be the first ones in play. Work together cross table to put some pressure on your Predator. Attempt to block every pool gain action of your Prey. Try to gain some, on every turn, with Enchant Kindred, Montreal/Dreams or Rack/Zombie/Vessel, besides Barranquilla. Be careful til the first one is ousted cause the deck can be depleted really fast! Survive this first stage of the game and you'll see it working WAY better, with 3 to 4 players on the table.

Took 10/13 potential VPs. 4VPs and 1GW at the final round.
