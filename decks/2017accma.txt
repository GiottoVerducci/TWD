-- 2GW7 + 2.5VP in final

Deck Name: Scout

Description: Stealth vote with tricks

My take on the archetype. I ditched Undele and Ashurs relatively early on as I
found them too slow and switched to a more parity shift focused style adding 2
extra princes (thanks for the tip on Karen Shan). Get lots of minions, keep the
pool lower so you can Zillah's to parity shift, and then Lily Prelude or
Reckless for the knock out.

Shatterings didn't really play that much of a part this weekend but they're a
great add on module. The two Heart of the City - thanks Julian - were also a
better bleed module than adding legal manipulations, with those and the
Legendary Vampires I usually had someone who could bleed for 3 at stealth - a
great plan since 94
