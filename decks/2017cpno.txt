-- 3vp in final

Deck Name: The Year of the Snake

designed and played by Jay Kristoff
Concept: Temptation is good in a meta where large vamps are quickly influenced and then nearly emptied with Minion Tap and Villein. The mega-political actions should be called while borrowing your neighbor's biggest vampire.
