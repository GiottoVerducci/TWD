Deck Name: Ahrimanes Rule of Four

Description: My Ahrimanes take on my "Toreador Rule of Four" deck. Ahrimanes
lose bounce and titles but gain more stealth and more blocking. Lesson Learned:
The Claws of the Dead are a good surprise but should probably just be Force of
Personality. Lesson Learned: To give prey hard choices - Pentex Loves You could
replace Fear of Mekhet.
