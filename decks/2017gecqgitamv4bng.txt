Deck Name: German ECQ 2017 (1st place): Matasuntha's unbound heart

This deck is a modified version of the one I played at the Grand-Prix in Budapest 2016 (https://www.secretlibrary.info/index.php?deck=view&id=22512).
It is very hard to force a GW (or sometimes even a VP) with it.
Wait for your chance, keep people guessing what your deck is able to do (and what not).
Heart of Nizchetus will help you waiting, Enkil Cog will increase your chances.
