Deck Name: Necrospace

For the best results, alter mustache to all vampires. All of them.
The most important thing (after mustache) playing this deck is to not die.
Storage Annex just isn't worth it. Extra hand size isn't an effect, it's just utility, and should be taken as such.
Charigger is pretty nifty if you're seated next to another Nocturne deck, but that's not often. Could be something else.
Shroud of Night is good, but should probably be a third piece of Spectral Divination and Shroud of Absence - that it can't be used in bleeds is pretty devastating after all.
Even with so much boring dominate, it's actually a lot of fun to play!
