-- 1GW7 (2nd seed) + 3VP in final

Deck Name: Good Old PRO-DOM

Entire crypt starts w/PRO; some have dom. Handful of dom skill cards, lots of
Govern. Decent bleeding, very decent blocking in the late game, some bouncing;
decent combat survivability. Iliana stars as prime actor; Caitlin supports as
primary blocker. This is a well-tested deck. The Weather Control is for Raptor
Decks, which are all too common in my local group, but it can double as stout
combat defense when coupled with a Flesh of Marble. Fun to play.
