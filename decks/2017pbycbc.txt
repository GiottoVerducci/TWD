-- 1.5VP in final

Deck Name: Maris' Rivers of Blood (Years of Darkness)

Heavily based on VENI VIDI VICI (Malkavian Princes) by Danilo Torrisi
http://www.secretlibrary.info/index.php?deck=view&id=20267

Replaced a banned card with a Wash and added 2x No Trace for Berkeley's combat-heavy meta. The S:CE came in handy when mobile intercept trumped my “measly” stealth... Still didn't beat Rötschreck, which hit Maris AND Orlando in the final.
Maris, Lutz, and Mental Maze are great deterrents to keeping Madness Network on the table (yeah duh I know, but I seldom play with or against Maris OR Lutz, and seeing people's ire toward them was eye-opening).
I only used My Kin Against the world once (in game 1), with Lutz and Maris. Discarded the rest; would have been way better if I had more Malks, but hey an extra action is an extra action (plus prey burns 1 pool with Lutz out), right?
