-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Big Gangrel

My Gangrel IC deck has been a staple for a long time. My recent update was
influenced by Martin Weinmayer's NAC deck. Your kill combo is Parity Shift +
Govern the Unaligned + Conditioning. Several fun tricks in the deck. First game
in the tournament, my predator was a power bleed deck. He Pentex Subversioned
my first vampire and then hit me for multiple bleeds for 5. He got me down to 2
pool before I came back to take all the VPs and the Game Win. This deck
survives way better than I expected with considerable pool gain. In the Finals,
I got to choose my predator and prey which gave me an overwhelming advantage.
The deck is a little too dependent on strike: combat ends and I will probably
add a Secure Haven.

Notes:
 Jake Washington	 - The Combo is with Vessel, but generic blood gain is good.
 Metro Underground	 - Fun with Enkil Cog but good after bleeding to setup bleed bounce.
 Pentex Subversion	 - Not great, because you never want to block the (D) action.
 Perfectionist	 - Free Govern the Unaligned.
 Zoo Hunting Ground	 - Two hunting grounds in play is very nice.
 Carlton Van Wyk - One of your best defense cards against Combat rush.
 Form of Mist	 - My ratio of combat cards is something I stole from Martin W.
 Heart of Nizchetus	 - Good, but not necessary.
 Seal of Veddartha	 - Better than the Heart.
 Scourge of the Enochians - played but never mattered.
 Banishment	 - This gets rid of problems and can cause more pool loss than parity shift.
 Guard Dogs	 - Fun with Enkil Cog, can get you to long range, and works with bounce.
