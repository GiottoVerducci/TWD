Deck Name: Chealth Bleese

Kenneth had a commanding start to the final, ousting two preys before being seriously threatened.

Other qualifying finalists:
Mark Jasper
David Anderson
Brandon Haas
Alex Orzulak

Nothing new here, it's based on Alexander Båskman's Glöggturnering: "Don't stop me now" deck. It's really the same thing, but swapping a Great Symposium for a Sudden Reversal.

The Dreams really help you deck yourself, which I did in 2 of 3 games (incl the 5-person final). Noteworthy that each tournament round had only 4-player tables, while the Final table had 5 players.

Deck dubbed "Chealth Bleese" by Rick Phillips, "Because it's like cheesy stealth bleed!" Many thanks to the Undead Persistence of the V:tES community that provided the resources to steal my first tournament win!
