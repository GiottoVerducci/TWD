Deck Name: The Dark Side of Politics

You normally need to bring out Giotto first, so that he can equip with the
Kaymakli Fragment, which will allow you to put titled vampires in play in a
cheaper way. Use Giotto's discard special ability in order to get the cards you
need, bearing in mind that you should be able to retrieve them later by means
of the Ashur Tablets. In case of a strong political opposition, discard some or
all political actions in your hand, and play Condemnation: Mute on the vampires
who deserve it, until you get the vote lock. The Textbook Damnation is in the
deck so that another vampire with Fortitude can also equip with the Kaymakli
Fragment and help Giotto move up to 6 blood down on a single turn.
