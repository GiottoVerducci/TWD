-- 2GW7 + 4VP in final

Deck Name: Matasuntha & Enkidu, a true bromance.

Bring out Matasuntha asap and play a passive wall early and mid game, keep a low profile.
Block strategically, try to totally destroy at least 1 vampire of your predator as deterrent.
Bleed with Matasuntha when you can, he doesn't need to stay untapped.
When your prey's vampires are all in torpor, bring out a small cap vamp/imbued to bleed.
Bring out Enkidu for the end game, if you bring him out too early, you lose your low profile and become a serious table threat.
Pool gain is slow, but defense is stable as long as you have Matasuntha ready, helps with keeping a low profile.
Table talk only when needed and don't be too aggressive in table talk, we're keeping a low profile.
