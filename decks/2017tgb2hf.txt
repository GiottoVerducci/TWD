-- 2GW5.5 + 0.5 in final

Deck Name: Montano Purge/Mind Rape
Created by: Akseli Jalava

Here's the list I played to get 3VP + 2.5vp in the prelims and glorious 0.5VP
in the finals to win the whole deal. The author of the deck is Akseli
Jalava; we switched decks prior to the tournament and I got the better end of
the deal, apparently.

The seating in the finals was:
Matti - weenie Malks with Madness Network and Talbot's Chainsaw (drawing no copies of either in the finals)
Petri - g5-6 Khazar's Diary with lots of Wraith-tech
me - Montano Purge/Mind Rape
Jukka - !Brujah anarch stealth bleed (Undue Influence+Power of One+Spoils of War)
Tommi - Eldest are Kholo breed/boon

2 hours, some passionate discussion and 2 Autarkis Persecutions later, no-one
got ousted, so I won as the highest seed. My game was basically ruined by
Petri's Calrton burning my Montano, but Petri didn't get to do the actions to
put out the wraiths to oust me because of weenie malks with permanent
intercept. Tommi was the closest to be ousted: constant pressure by Jukka's
!Bru bleeders plus 2 Delaying Tactics by Jukka during the same turn got Tommi
to 1 pool before he bounced back to healthy 20-ish pool total in one turn.

I'd suggest dropping Lucita for 3rd Moncada and adding probably at least one
Villein. Camarilla Vitae Slave is cute but not worth the effort. Monastery
should probably be in there, too.
