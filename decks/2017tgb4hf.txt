Deck Name: The Tremere War Chantry

Oldschool, balanced fair deck. Slow&steady.
Bored of "villein for 11, giants blood, superior govern,
freak drive, scouting mission, freak, mindrape, freak, Banishment on your deflecter+push+cap+freak, bleed for 5+."-games?

This deck mainly bleeds for 1's, while acting like the Tremeres always do. They must be hiding something really scary,
as they don't seem to be doing much. Truth being, they just don't do much.
