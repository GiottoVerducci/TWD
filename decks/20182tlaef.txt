Deck Name: GoraTRIX

The deck is ancient and I have no idea the original author is! I would be more
than happy to credit him/her.

My version has a couple more enhanced senses than usual. Less eyes of argus->
more sense the savage way(I just love the card) and some read the winds,
because they are awesome with Goratrix. Goratrix loves his untaps, so I have
26+Mylan. Also in my opinion Anastasz di Zagreb is too expensive for what it
does and Devin is awesome, so a little switch-a-roo there.
