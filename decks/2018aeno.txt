-- 1GW4 + 3vp in final

Deck Name: Dream a Little Dream

Description: A Sabbat variant of my 'Vitel and Friends' deck.

This deck was played in an environment that almost never sees Ashur Tablets.
The goal is to have a complete set of Ashur Tablets by the mid-game, but the
second set (each coming with less than 3 cards left in my library) proved key
to each game win that I earned. My intent was mostly to recycle Dreams of the
Sphinx, Dream World, and stealth, which happened for the first set. The second
sets were all stealth as the environment had more intercept than I expected.

Sunset Strip, Hollywood was key to my Blood Doll farming in game two, but all
my Dolls were Vesseled away in the finals. I managed to have vote lock or with
Powerbase: Madrid enough votes to pass my Con Boons whenever I wanted them. In
the finals I had 14 minions. With the plus-bleed from Dream World, I managed to
get Procurers in on the bleed action, too, which is one reason I use them over
other tech.
