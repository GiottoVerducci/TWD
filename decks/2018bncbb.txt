Deck Name: Anson Gunz

-- 2gw7.5 + 2.5vp in the finals.

switched a little bit the crypt after the last tournament to include more
weenies and seems to work better. The problem of the deck is that you strongly
rely on bleeds for 1, so you need to be a little bit opportunistic with the
kills and do not hesitate to deal the points on the table with someone capable
to help you. If there is some deck that bloats much, do not hesitate to do
whatever is needed to avoid him from bloating. Bloat = you loose.
