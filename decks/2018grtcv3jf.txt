Deck Name: The Devils Dogs

The deck is based around the deck "Bad Dreams" by Noora Hirvonen. Huge thanks to her for inspiration and for making me to want to play the deck after witnessing it in action at the Berlin EC 2017.

Made some changes to the deck list to better suit my play style and personal preference. Also there were some card availability issues, which is why there is no Contagion and there is some Aire of Elations, as I did not have enough Sense the Sins. Although I got one oust because of that, as I had Aire to play after one Sense got DI'd.

Big thanks to Jyri Puhakka too, for selling me the idea of playing New Blood. It was key to the victory during finals!

Marked Terriories and Abbot are in the deck to basically be "Unleash Hell's Fury" number 4 and 5. And the synergy between Alex Camille and Abbot is super nice. Making the deck a bit more resilient with the larger amount of S:CEs
