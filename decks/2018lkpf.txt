-- 2GW6 + 1.5VP in final

Deck Name: Crows and Bats

As I don't like tweaking good solid decks before playing them, and since it's
the first time I was playing it, it is the list Orian gave me of the deck he
played on the French NC day 1, give or take 3 cards. I did the following
changes: - 1 Pentex +1 Lifeboon and- 2 Underbridge Sray +2 Canine Horde. I know
that Orian adores his little puppies, but I don't. My changes were minor...
Pentex for Lifeboon is a matter of taste. For this tournament, Lifeboon was
useless and I would have prefered a Pentex. It's less versatile than Pentex but
it can always give an opportunistic GW. All the rest is the same, one could
slightly tweak the fight on 5 cards I'd say.
