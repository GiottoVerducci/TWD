Deck Name: Royal Kebab (sauce blanche)
Created by: Orpheus

Description: They make the best Kebab In Town !

Yes, the Assamites belong in the Camarilla and they can vote better than most ! ^^
I made many versions of this deck. It used to be Assamites only with Tegyrius merged also, but his absence of Obf is too dangerous in the current meta. So I mixed with some Malks and pumped up on the stealth.
I should probably get back to 4 Al-Ashrad advanced in 13 vamps, or maybe in 12 if I really want Maris too.
The reste of the deck worked liked a charm, maybe I could add a Telepathic Misdirection and / or an Eye of Argus, they can be cycled easily enough with Rebekah. I used to play Telepathic Vote Counting but with the locs I usually can pass or deal my votes.
