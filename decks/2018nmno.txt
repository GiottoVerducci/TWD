-- 1GW4 + 1.5VP in final

Deck Name: Anarch Diary (Firesale Remix)
Created by: Karl Schaefer

Description: Anarch Khazar's Diary Deck

Updated from my Origins version, where I missed the finals on tournament points. I added more
cards, dropping most of my stealth for Liquadation and Sudario Refraction. The minimal stealth
worked well today, but the key to both rounds that the deck performed well in was to get a
Khazar's into play before my predator or prey had any minions to block with.

As I expected it was an ally heavy day with the final having 3 ally decks:
Alex (Garou) 1.5 VP ->
Mariya (Anneke/Anson toolbox) 0 VP ->
Me 1.5 VP ->
Mark (Shamblers and Hookers) 0 VP ->
Jeff (Gargoyle Razor Bat wall) 0.5 VP

I actually didn't play The Unmasking in the final because of Mark's allies, though he played it a
turn later. Alex had the first oust, but the Diary was primed by that point. I kept whittling Mark
down to 1 pool and putting more wraiths into play, hoping to lunge and get both Mark and Jeff in a
single turn. As time wound down, I got Mark, but on 5 actions I couldn't get a single wraith bleed
to succeed against Jeff. Realizing the with little time remaining my best bet was to turtle up as
both my predator and prey ganged up on me and I could do very little against 4 minions with
standing intercept. I could have probably lasted only a few more turns, but timed was called.

Thanks to Orpheus for a few tips on the deck.

For certain decks I've upped my Converts from 5/13 to 6/13; proved useful for this deck.

Library (76 cards)
Master (20; 4 trifle)
2x Acquired Ventrue Assets -- gold as always
1x Anarch Railroad
2x Direct Intervention
3x Jake Washington -- with Vessel this is a guaranteed counter on the diary
3x Liquidation -- funny, I liquidated my two other Liquations in the final
1x Pentex(TM) Subversion
3x Piper -- perhaps 1-3 more would be useful; what to remove?
1x Powerbase: Cape Verde
4x Vessel

Action (21)
1x Abomination -- didn't get into play today, but has in the past; could remove
1x Chair of Hades -- blocked every time I tried to use it, but was great for feints nonetheless; warning does not add a counter to the Diary
5x Embrace, The
8x Khazar's Diary (Endless Night) -- might consider 1 more
1x Soul Feasting -- expected to see Legionaires; didn't use, but good in theory
5x Sudario Refraction

Ally (15)
2x Carlton Van Wyk
5x Cry Wolf -- the bread and butter of the Anarch Khazar deck
1x Gianna di Canneto -- burned a .44 in rounds 1 and 3; perhaps another?
1x Giulia Giovanni Abruzzina
1x Gregory Winter
1x Grey Thorne
1x Ossian -- never played him today
1x Repo Man
1x Tye Cooper -- so good, but stolen twice!
1x Vivienne Géroux -- proved very useful for this deck; she bled for 5 pool, no one would block her

Reaction (12)
4x Deflection
1x Delaying Tactics
