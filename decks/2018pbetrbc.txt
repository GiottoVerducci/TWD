-- 1GW4 + 1.5VP in final

Deck Name: Anu's Legion
Created by: Mark Jasper

Final: Mark Jasper (Anu and Legionairres)
 -> Lev Jasper (Unnamed Barrenness Twister)
 -> Kenneth Davenport (Camarilla Followers of Set stealth vote)
 -> David Anderson (Nergal Force of Will Bleedzooka)
 -> Rick Phillips (G2-3 Anarch Tremere/Tremere Anti Toolbox)

Description: A more bleedy version of the Legion of Skulls deck I won with in June. That deck was a bit slow so this one is trying to get faster ousts by using Anu Dipnitatpa's special ability. Bring out a Harbinger or two, some Legionairres and then Anu to make all of their bleeds for 2. Soul Feasting and some other blood gain stuff to refill Anu. Didn't draw Anu in the final, but I had the top seed and managed to oust my brother with 1 minute to spare. I actually think the version I won with in June is better, since it is less threatening and more versatile. Legionairres are awesome. Very strong, but not overpowered.
