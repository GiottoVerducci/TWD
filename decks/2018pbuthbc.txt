-- 1GW3 + 3VP in final

Deck Name: Legion of Skulls

Description: Legionairres are awesome. You really just need to recruit one and
keep one alive. The rest can come from your ash heap as it grows. The first one
costs 1 pool, the rest only cost 7 cards from your ash heap each. Liquidation
is key, as it gives you 3 pool and pays the cost of Legionairres. Vengeful
Spirits are lovely too. Very fun deck. Hooray for new cards and a TWD featuring
Harbingers of Skulls!
