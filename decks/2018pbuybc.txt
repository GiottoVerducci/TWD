-- 1.5VP in final

Deck Name: Semi-Turbo Capuchin

Thanks to Martin Schumacker for playing a similar deck a couple of times on
Lackey and giving me the inspiration to make this deck. The core idea from
Martin is to use Coroner's Contact to pull out whatever Samedi (4 in deck) are
left in the crypt and use Soul Gem with 100% chance of drawing another
Capuchin. You give the Capuchin Obfuscate, the Soul Gem, and Villein down to 2.
Then do the classic Force of Will bleed with Daring the Dawn at inferior and
Conditioning to bleed for 7, unblockable by vampires, burn the Capuchin and get
a new unlocked Capuchin to Villein later. This deck can bloat a ton! Use Under
My Skin (on two actions each) to stealth past allies. Obviously, rushing
allies like Ossian and Garous are really bad news for this deck since Samedi
besides Baroque (Auspex!) have no intercept. The Capuchin is the star, so if
he goes to torpor you’re toast. Best strategy is to be patient, wait until all
Samedi are in uncontrolled region, blocking some actions with the Capuchin when
you have Obedience and bouncing bleeds while looking innocent and staying good
on pool. Then, when you’re prey gets down to 10 pool or so, Villein down to 3,
Magic out the Soul Gem, and have two left to pay for Force of Will and
Conditioning, get a new Capuchin and repeat, semi-turbo style. Fun deck to
play.
1.5VP in final (won tiebreaker as 2nd seed).
