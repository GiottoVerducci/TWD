-- 1GW3 + 4VP in final

Deck Name: Haamujengi - Always the right answer.

As already discused in Deck clinic. Alafin is what makes the deck go.
The ability has to be used to it's fullest, so don't give out free discards to others when they need them. You have to be smart about it...
You will be milling yourself so much that you don't get to play every card in the deck.
But you will be able to use the right cards at the right time, so don't get distracted with things that are "good".
Focus on the cards that will actually win you the game.
Also plan ahead, you have enough recursion to get the things you need, but most of the time you need a turn or 2 to get there, so plan your actions correctly and don't get caught on the critical one.
Overly simplified: If you are thinking: Should I discard to Alafin? The answer is yes... it will get you more Legionnaires and you can get everything back if you really need it...
