-- 2GW8.5 + 0.5VP in final

Deck Name: Ennustaja

Based on Goratrix EC 2015 Day 2: Goratrix Anarch build by Marcin
Watras (wargrim) which in turn is based on Goratrix builds created by
Tomasz Kowalewski and Alain Greiner.

Slight modifications were made to suit the Ropecon tournament
environment, mainly some combat added:P

Devin Bisley was replaced by Anton because of +1 intercept and the
ability to play Sense the Savage Way.

Also, why 88 cards? Well, I bought 100 lucky shields from Mallorca ->
put 12 to a crypt -> lost the crypt somewhere -> still, they are lucky
shields so..

And finally, thanks to Tuukka for borrowing some cards for me!:D Go V:tES!!
