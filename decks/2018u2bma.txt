Deck Name: Defend the Ghosts!
Created by: Adam Hulse

Description: Ben Peal's Tournament Winning Deck for the Boston Tournament on 10/13/18
The idea is to defend and play cards so that more and more legionnaires can come into play. Enough stealth to also bring them into play normally, which adds to the total number of legionnaires one can play in the game. In my rush I forgot to add Vagabound mystic and FBI Special Affairs Division
