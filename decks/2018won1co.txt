-- 1GW6 + 2VP in final

Deck Name: Cardinal BeneDICKtion

This deck was built around a conversation I saw on a group about how cardinal
benediction is an inferior card. I just felt that was asinine so I combined it
with some of the most heinous cards in the game to create this little
monstrosity. Fear of Mekhet, Pentex, Banishment, Conceal, Scalpel Tongue,
Disarming Presence and Derange can all be game breaking cards at the right
time. The deck is at its best with an aggressive prey as it can just play the
unassuming role and be at 20+ pool before doing anything of note.

The final was definitely this case as I had a lasombra stealh bleed prey and a
Mambo Jeanne beat face cross table to scare everyone. I was able to get a
reverse win with my predator going first then his predator and so on. By time
the stealth bleed prey got his VP I was sitting comfortably at around 40 pool
after turns of black forest and capping with Armin's special.

The recursion from Waste Management Operation is essential as there aren't a ton
of offensive votes in the deck. Once in play it needs to be used every turn to
push offensive votes and the right modifiers back into your deck. Protected
resources slows the game down and often times discourages your prey from
attempting to bleed.

Gurchon Hall doesn't need to be in the deck as I never got any mileage out of it.
Probably better off being another Minion Tap or offensive vote. Probably Ancilia
Empowerment with the current Ally heavy climate.
