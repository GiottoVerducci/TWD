-- 1GW3 + 4VP in final

Deck Name: A Question of When
Created by: Darby Keeney

Description: Starts slowly with some Anarch Revolt pressure and bleeds of 1-2, ramps output with permanents and increasingly dense combat in the late game (Ashur Tablet cycles).

Nana and/or Aksinya tend to drive defense and make opportunistic offensive moves. Smaller minions do most bleeding/rushing in the midgame.

-- Omitting Carlton Van Wyk was a grave error, rectified during this write-up.

Only expected to need 1-2 cycles of Tablets and I was concerned that 2 more would interrupt card flow early in the game. I couldn't go with more acceleration for the same reason, It's also necessary to jettison Masters early in most games, even at "only" 34 cards.
-- The pair of untap locations are mostly used if Aksinya shows in the opening crypt.

Unfortunately, this deck is almost exclusively 1 action per minion per turn with a light reaction package, I had to lean away from a loads of permacept. The Sport Bike above replaces one Raven Spy, because it can be moved and it leverages that tiny bit of untap following equip actions.

Red Question proved to be great. Nana converted mid-action and dropped Monkey Wrench on a Codex bleed in the final. It can also be played after combat on a blocked action, so it's easy to crank out a safety net for the Revolts. Clears the hand easily (burn option or Powerbase:LA) if not needed.

I'm pretty casual about blocking unless permacept AND an untap location come up early. Backrushing remains a control option if the defense angle isn't enough.
