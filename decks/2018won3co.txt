-- 1GW4 + 3VP in final

Deck Name: Pictures at an Exhibition

Description: Based entirely around abusing Baba Yaga's untap special. Suffers from the star-syndrome, and is completely Pentex-sensitive.

This is way, way thicker a master package than I like to run, but at least 7 are trifles and I expect 5-6 to be clear discards or Heart fodder. But the acceleration is pretty important in getting the deck to function quickly enough to be a factor in the mid-game.
-- I've gone back and forth on Monastery of Shadows in this deck. I've omitted it for now, simply because of the 3-pool cost. The deck could also run a Smiling Jack, but I loathe the way that card makes me play when it's in front of me (or for that matter, anywhere else.)
-- I pulled a Bleeding the Vine for Wash just before heading to Origins. It usually sat in my hand because Pentex exists. Jake Washington was also a late addition, not useful in these 3 games, but low blood totals tend to hamstring this deck.

I thought there was a Flak Jacket in here, but it must have gotten culled for additional transient prevention and untaps.

The bleed retainers are the source of the real offense in the deck, adding to the 3 minions with +1 bleed. At least once per game, Baba Yaga will fire off an Archon-able bleed without any coverage from the Owl Companion. I just press the big red button and hope for the best.

Yes, I know the bounce package is pathetically weak. But Baba Yaga seems to prefer blocking. So I've focused instead on reactions that give both intercept and true untap. Baba Yaga standing tall with 1-3 intercept and 4-5 strength seems to be a significant deterrent to continuing actions.

2x Rolling with the Punches -- I've moved more towards Resilience these days, since [ANI] is more common than [CEL] in my playgroup. The Grapples have to be well-timed to mean anything, but I've found having them in the deck is crucial.
