-- 1GW6 + 3VP in final

Deck Name: Swedish Legionnaires

This deck is based on a deck by Erik Mossberg (SWE). Made some changes, not all
for the better, nevertheless the deck worked like a charme, especially in the
finals. Score was gw 3 vp/1.5 vp/1.5 vp, entering the finals 3rd rank (2nd rank
due to a drop). gw 3 vp in the finals, which ended in an epic heads-up. Thanks
go to: Erik and the whole Stockholm playgroup, for their kindness in general
and for willingly sharing decklists. To my playgroup, for accepting to play on
tournament level in every single casual game. To the organisers, Sebastian
Meurer (new Prince of Freiburg) and the owners of the awesome shop "Kainskind"
(Childe of Caine).
