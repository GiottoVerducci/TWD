-- 2GW9 + 4VP in final

Deck Name: Guillaume's Real Estate Agency

I have been playing and tweaking this deck basically since I started playing,
a year and a half ago, and I'm very happy that it is finally in the TWDA, after
missing two opportunities in the 2018 French National Championship.

This is a toolbox bleed deck, with tons of install and lategame power thanks to
all the permanent locations, that aims to keep good tempo, by playing Nocturn
and not actually wasting actions for install effects.

It's very fun to play and it can clearly be tweaked to one's liking, although I
feel now that the core of the list is pretty much set in stone.
