Deck Name: Anson's beautifull Tongue

Here is my Aching Beauty deck.

The below deck is an adaptation a deck from Armen Khachikyan who won the
Russian EC of 2016 with it. He has an intresting angle for playing aching
beauty so I wanted to try it. Look it up on www.vekn.fr/decks/twd.htm

I decided to use group 1/2 instead of 3/4. I think it is better if you don't
use OBF. Also Ashur fits so well in this kind of deck.

So in advance some changes to the below deck.
 -5 Telepathic Misdirection, +5 Deflection: Oh boy I was defenceless a lot of the times and I got away with it. Anson without superior Auspex is a problem.
 -1 Flurry of Actions, +1 Powerbase: Montreal or Voter Captivation
 -1 Political Stranglehold, +1 Ancient Influence
 +1 Aire of Elations: I thought it was already in the deck but I guess I forgot to include it.
 -1 Masika, +1 Francois Villon: Masika was never on the table, but it feels like Francois is stronger in this type of deck. His ability emptied a Dominate vampire and caused an oust.
