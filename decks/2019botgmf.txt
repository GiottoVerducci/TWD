-- 1GW4 + 5VP in final

Deck Name: Emerald crusher

Description: PRECONSTRUCTED DECK “Reign of Stanislava”. Made some changes.

Nice tournament with lots of new players.

Final Seating was:

Vincent Dormois (!Ventrue grinder) -> Christophe Baltazar (Emerald Legionnaire) -> Alain Greiner (Emerald Legionnaire) -> Sébastien Ragache (Stanislava) -> Thomas Hautecouverture (Emerald Legionnaire)

The final includes 3 “Emerald legionnaire” decks. Alain, Thomas and Christophe were playing same crypts with emeralds. The 3 emeralds players have to share the vampires to avoid the contest. Quickly they develop their game. An early unmasking prevents Vincent from passing his equipments / govern / hunt. The game crystallizes between Thomas and Vincent who plays a !ventrue grinder deck. Vincent temporarily resist with sticks, prevents and much bounce bleed. Gradually, Thomas exhausts Vincent’s vamps. Christophe and Alain ditto. So Sébastien, with his deck stanislava, makes his game without real predator. He passes his prey in stealth. When the situation is unblocked with the death of Thomas, the table is so fragile that Sébastien has only to pick up the crumbs.
