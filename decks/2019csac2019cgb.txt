-- 2GW6 + 2VP in final

Deck Name: Harringer of skulls mk II

I upgraded the deck since last entry to have a few more combat ends since I was
having a few problems with table hate/rush the rest remained the same. This
deck is pretty much a toolbox deck with a lot of recursion with the
legionaires. You try to put 2 vampires in play at the same time, preferably
erlik and Erebus using erliks ability. Focus Erebus on calling emeralds every
turn to create a wall versus rush decks, leave a vampire untapped to block
entrancement if necessary and bleed as much as necessary. The only changes I
would make right now is a few delaying tactics if you expect a voting metagame.
