-- 1GW5.5 + 1.5VP in final

Deck Name: Girls will find Liquidity

Seating order was:
 Aapo (Girls will find Liquidity) ->
 Alain (Giovanni g23 Shambling Hordes) ->
 Rudolf (Harbinger of Skulls Wallish Emerald Legionnaires) ->
 Magnus (Presence Weenies) ->
 Marius (Giovanni g23 Shambling Hordes)

I do not remember who was starting player.

Nothing new here, pretty basic Girls deck. This variant is based on the deck by
Otso Saariluoma, which he used to win the Finnish NC 2018. Removed some cards
to get the deck size down, and added a couple of Mirror Walks, to allow Aksinya
to act a bit better if necessary, and to spread out the stealth package more.
Could have used Mistress Fanchon instead of Rafael or Adana, but I opted out of
it as she is lacking Presence.

I also had a bit heavier investment on the Baali stuff, added a second Unleash
Hell's Fury as I expected a lot of combat, Contagion to help with wearing down
the opponents, and couple of I am Legions, because the ability to cancel Auspex
is really good, and I like the ability to use it like instant speed "blood
doll" to gain some pool, or to pay the Infernal tax in advance.
