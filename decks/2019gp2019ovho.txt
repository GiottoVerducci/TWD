Deck Name: Detect Legionnaire Authority

Babalawo Anarch Legionnaire with Crow. Use Detect Authority for general
protection against rushes, actions to burn Maabara, attempts to steal
Legionnaires or PB:Los Angeles, and bleeds. Highly reactive deck with swarm
Legionnaire bleed as its entire ousting mechanism.

The deck is fun to play and defensively sound. Parthenon in concert with
Maabara is quite powerful (e.g., D.I. every turn). Legionnaires are OP.

I would like to add back one Trochomancy and/or one Monkeywrench. I also
might experiment with a couple of Gear Ups. Other than that, likely wonâ€™t
do much to change this build.
