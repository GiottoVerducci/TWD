-- 1GW5 + 3VP in final

Deck Name: Full Shift while you can

Our friendly player from Mikkeli organized again tournament at his home in
Mikkeli, Extra thanks to Lasse for having amazing place, in middle drive from
Joensuu, Helsinki and also easy to access from Tampere and Jyv채skyl채

We had amazing number of players 15, 6 from Joensuu, 5 from Helsinki area, 2
from Jyv채skyl채 and 1 from Tampere, and obviously our host Lasse from Mikkeli.

Personally I haven't had such great games in a long while, and the final was
extremely exciting and close one between me and Esku, new Swedish Champion.

finals seating was:
Esa-Matti (Stanislava 25th anniversary starter) - Simo(Sha-Ennu Reaction denial) - Pasi (Tzimische toolbox) - Lauri (Alonso/Gabrielle/Fanchon/Orlando vote) - Lasse (Khursid Emerald)

i was third seed, so I decided to go infront of Tzimiche instead of Sha-Ennu,
cause I knew what that was, and then Esku decided to go infront of me, and
finaly Lasse decided to sit between me and Esku.

I had really fast start, playing dreams and then 2 Zillahs valleys to get
alonso and Mistress Fanchon up

played alastor to get Helicopter on alsonso and also played Signet of King
saul, to make my preys and predators life hard. they had at first only big caps
and couldn't block Alonso.

The game turned out hard though Sha-ennu did help a little by giving pressure
to my predator, but my prey the legionaires had too much pool and didn't get
many legionaires up first, but luckily he did not know his loaned deck well
enough for me atleast.

Eventually Esku ousted Sha-ennu with Stanislava and we had only four players
left, but since both my predator had gotten lower caps in, I was no longer
unblockable and didn't draw enough stealth I thought I was in trouble, so I
told Esku to go forwards that I will help him oust his second prey, if I get
like 1 turn peace after that. Finaly just 14 minutes left in time he ousted
Pasi, and that was point when Lasse started to play, getting plenty of
legionaires and so on.

Lucky for me, Esku did Parity shift backwards, gaining 3 pool, and allowing me
to cast Anarchist uprising to out Lasse, and then I played Ancilla empowerment
to lower Eskus pool to 1, and then it was easy enough to anounce bleed for 1,
and stealth it through, since I had drawn finaly my stealth cards, by the help
of Heart of cheating. When I did my last oust from Esku to gain 3 vps in Finals
there was only 1 and about 20 seconds left in clock. So I secured a victory
with 3 vps in the final


The deck was too big, and after the tournament I removed 15 cards from it making it 75 card deck.
