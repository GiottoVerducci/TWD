-- 1GW6.5 + 1.5VP in final

Deck Name: the Hoody Gang

Basically every game is like being in a tunnel with the light at the very end.
Survive and let others die while u build up permacept and try to influence your
second puncher; let them underestimate the blocking capacities of the deck
and kill whatever is left on the table, preferably gaining pool with mata special.

removed the dragonbound for a wash (vs pentex) but it needs to go in again.
bleeding on a prey with 12 pool and 6 minions in torpor is kinda annoying slow.
