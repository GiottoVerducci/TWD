-- 1GW3 + 3VP in final

My second tournament win came about with a deck that I had been prepping for a
few months with very consistent results. The meta was very combat-heavy, which
I thought would be bad for me but somehow I survived. I guess playing
cautiously and trying not to do too much in early game is the secret to this
archetype.

Very minor changes to previous versions. It seems to be particularly important
for this deck to be as slim as possible, so I try to always keep it at 65
