-- 1GW4 + 3VP in final

Deck Name: Take 30 Tablets and Call Me in the Morning

Deck was fun and resilient. If I were to play it again, I would include one more anti-location card (either Unnatural Disaster or a second Dominate Kine) and one or two bits of intercept (maybe KRCG and an Eyes of the Night). Oh, and a Great Symposium would be a nice add as well.

Final Seating
Grayson (Giovanni tap n bleed) -> Burt (Arika multi-act) -> Bill (Kiasyd Tablets) -> Geoff (Setites bleed/minion stealing) -> Darby (Giovanni stealth bleed)
