-- 2GW8.5 + 4VP in final

Deck Name: Montano PURGE

Thanks to Otto & Jura for arranging the tournament!

Finalists:
Jari (Lutz vote+bleed) → Marko (Purge) → Pauli (Ventrue sticks, 2nd trads & daring the dawn bleeds) → Jaakko (Vignes bleed) → Pasi (Kiasyd SB with combat surprise)

Description: Traditional Baltimore Purge deck built around Montano. Inspiration was taken from Akseli Jalava's similar deck. After struggling in the previous tournament against Scourge, I switched crypt's 2 caps to be a generation or two older. This made the deck a bit slower to start but allowed me to include Scourge card to burn other weenies like Tupdogs that are a constant headache in Finnish meta. As a post-Pentex-nerf update, I tested to take two Pentex cards away, and replace one of them with Blind Spot. I would consider adding a 5th Graverobbing as it sparks joy among fellow methuselahs.
