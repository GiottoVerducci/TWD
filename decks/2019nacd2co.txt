-- 2GW7.5 + 4VP in final

Deck Name: MMPA Stealth bleed/vote

I tried out girls a lot but felt like it was missing something. Losing Aksinya was a big hurdle but there are a lot of good vamps in group 1-2 with titles and dominate. Getting to vote more consistently and bounce occasionally makes me a bit happier. This is the refined version of the deck I won with in Newark OH a few months ago. I made some adjustments for Origins that I probably shouldn't have, namely that I took out Archon Investigation in favor of a Not to Be. I hate Unmasking/Veil of Darkness/Rising and saw 2/3 of them but didn't have the not-to-be to stop them anyways.

I go back and forth on Voter cap at 1-2. Parity Shift may come out as I discard it most often in favor of an Ancilla Empowerment. I'm not sold on Sarrasine/Kephamos other than it's nice to have other minions to bring up. Other than that the deck has proven to be pretty tight.
