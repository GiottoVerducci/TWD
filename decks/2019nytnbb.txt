-- 2GW9.5 + 2VP in final

Deck Name: Just another nasty bleeddeck

This is the very focused bleeddeck with a few very simple principles.
1 Handmanagement: have minimum amout of cards that can clog, and cards that increase card options. low amount of masters also helps.
2 blood management: other masters are to keep the machine rolling.
3 bleedmanagement: Well Duh! all the other cards are for bleeding
