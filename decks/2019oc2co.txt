-- 1GW3 + 4VP in final

Deck Name: Mean Mister Master

Joined the tournament in round 2 and squeaked into the final with 1GW3.
Won final with 4VP; finishing move was playing Curse of Nitocris and passing the turn. Played Gambit Accepted in both games.

This is not a terribly interesting deck. It's just another example of Kindred Spirits being conducive to pairing with just about any master package you could want. In this case, I focused on masters that do pool damage, hence the title, “Mean Mister Master.”
