-- 1GW5 + 1.5VP in final

Deck Name: Valkyries with Veles Hunt

Final Table: Alex Orzulak (Goratrix and Kazimir Savostin Black Hand toolbox) -> Brandon Haas (Tupdogs Bruise bleed) -> Ian Lee (!Malk stealth bleed with EMPs) -> Mark Jasper (G5-6 Samedi rush combat) -> David Anderson (Brunhilde and Valkyrie Anarch Vote)


Valkyries vote spam, with some bleed. Light stealth. I think I got really lucky
to win with this. It's mostly a pile of cards I threw together the night
before. It really could use a LOT more tuning. The votes that are in there are
a smattering of stuff I wanted to try out. It could use a bit more combat
defense (maybe S:CE and agg hands), and a couple fewer Master cards. Firebrand
is great! Ennoia's Theater is fantastic since Dreams always gets contested.
