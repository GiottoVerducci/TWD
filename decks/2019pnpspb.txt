Deck Name: The Walking Dead
Created by: Delmar

Description: Samedi Trap + reanimated corpse
A very agressive deck, with a combination of rush and bleed 2 with zumbies.

Last table: Me > Maurão's multi rush Lorrie > Henrique's typhonic beast rush > Fabi's Goratrix Wall > Desso's low cap AUS.
A very very long game, with me beeing the bad guy. I got 2vp before my deck finished and somehow survived the rest of
the game (Fabi would get the table in the long run).

Goodies: Comparing with bleed actions, the reanimated corpse does the same damage per action, with the
same blood cost, and less cards (bleed + Govern + Conditioning = 6 pool dmg, costing 2 blood; the zumbies
do the same pool damage for the same cost and only 1 card). Because you spend a lot less slots to do the pool dmg,
you can use them in the form of combat cards that both zumbies and samedies can use, making this deck much harder
to deal with rush and intercept.

Badies: 1- No bleed Deflection! Must have Baroque to rush your predator if he/she is S&B; 2- S&B decks only need
to deal 15 or less damage to oust your first prey, before geting your first VP it is very possible that the entire table is
working against you and everybody can rescue vampires in torpor.

Changes: My deck ended in most my games, so more cards. The 8 and 9 cap vamps only slowed me down, so more of the
low cap ones. A version with anarch convert and revolt could be tested.
