Deck Name: Farley Mowat V2.01

Named after the author of the hilarious book "Never Cry Wolf," this is a
twice-modified version of previously winning deck. This iteration seems more
stable than previous versions. And I absolutely should have played this for the
previous day's Cup event, when I was 100% certain there would be at least one
Legionnaire deck floating around.

The kinda-recent sect inheritance change helps with Cry Wolf and the Railroad, so Seattle Committee and Twilight Camp could be removed from the library.

This isn't THAT many allies to transform, but there are usually possibilities from other players' ash heaps before harvesting my own.
