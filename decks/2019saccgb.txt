-- 1GW5 + 4VP in final

Deck Name: Ishtarri Bleed & Vote Multiaction
Created by: Rivanildon Frazão

Deck was originally created by my friend Patrick Alves then fine tuned by me.
As all crypt have basic obf, there is 4 forgotten labyrinth for political
actions and also there is some telepathic misdirections that only Eugene and
Ayo Igoli can play. I usually start with Ayo Igoli and try to enchant kindred at
superior to hasten the deck. Undele's special with kiss of Ra and banishments
are very strong in the endgame, and in the final table helped me win, since
there was 10+ anarch revolts in play.
