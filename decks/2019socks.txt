Deck Name: Montano OBT DOM ANI POT - Kragujevac tournament win

Final table order:
1 - The unnamed - Predrag Savic
2 - Stanislava - Milutin Melka
3 - Montano - Nikolaj Wendt
4 - Giovanni powerbleed - Milos Krstic
5 - Lutz - Nikola Obradovic

Report:

The unnamed starts first and brings up Anarch Convert. Next comes one of
Giovannies and immediately makes a pressure on Lutz. Lutz is in big trouble,
which leaves space for The unnamed to grow. Stanislava tries to put pressure on
Montano, but after a few fights, she is left with almost empty vampires.
Giovanni ousts Lutz, but Unleash Hell's Fury keeps them from brainless bleed.
As Montano begins to pressure Giovanni, The unnamed gets the score on
Stanislava. Giovanni falls. The unnamed has plenty of pool, and expects a rush
from Montano. One rush ends in Fury, and the second meets The unnamed. The
unnamed is Grappled and can't use Rotschreck, so it goes to final death. The
unnamed tries to rise again by influence, but it's too late because bleed of 8
made it impossible. The winner is known.

Congratulations to Nikolaj Wendt!

Description: Montano is an absolute beast.
