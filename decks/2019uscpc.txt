-- 2GW8 + 3VP in final

Deck Name: The Capitalist are coming!

Background: So, originally was going to play a Harbinger deck, but there were several at the tournament. Contesting is an easy way to lose, so swap to Kiasyd.

This is simply my power bleed Kiasyd (there many on TWDA). I doubled up on the group 4-5 Kiasyd to make Song of Pan more potent.

Note: Could be less, but I was worried about running out of steam on bloat machines.

Note: No pool gain, you need all the blood on the vampires to pay for cards, thus The Coven and Capitalist.

Note: This is all bleed, you never Govern down unless it nets you +1 Vampire.

Note: Combat could happen, but really this is for Song of Pan.
