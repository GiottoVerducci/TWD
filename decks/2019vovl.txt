-- 1GW5 + 3VP in final

Deck Name: Unstoppable Sha Ennu

I think 7-8 Will-o-the-Wisps would be better. I couldn't find so many and added
1 copy of Changeling, Fiendish tongue and Occlusion instead. Had no chance to
play Golconda and Festivo delo Estinto. Probably they can be removed. Bujo -
just for fun)
