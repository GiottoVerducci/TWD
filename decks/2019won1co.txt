-- 1GW5 (3rd seed) + 4VP in final

Deck Name: Hybrid Legionnaire 4.2

Most proud of this deck for the synergy between Mina, Thomasso,
Jake Washington, Shambler rush and Tye Cooper. Mina gets blood
when Tye eats vamps that the Shamblers torporize. She can push
blood to Thomasso with his special. If you push Mina's last
blood to him, you can pop Jake for her in the same phase.

This deck swarms fairly quickly with Shamblers and Legionnaires.
Called "Hybrid" because it uses burn-option cards in addition to
Specialization/Liquidation for dumping cards to power Legionnaires.
If I were to play it again, I might remove the Specializations in
exchange for a couple more Liquidations and a few Funeral Wakes.
That said, Specialization did save me from being ousted by Fame
in torpor in the final round, so it's hard to hate it.
