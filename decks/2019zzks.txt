-- 0gw2.5 + 3VP in final

Deck Name: Spanish Ladies AV

Final round was:
Visnja Ilic (Weenies bleed) ->
Milos Krstic (Kiasyd/Lasombra stealth and bleed) ->
Nikola Zmiro (Tzimisce wall) ->
Petar Zivkovic (Tremere toolbox) ->
Milutin Melka (Fakir with Akunanse block and rush)

A finely tuned version of established stealth and bleed deck archetype,
improved by additional Crypt acceleration and Crypt filtration using Anarch
Converts to avoid duplicate vampires and make use of transfers to the fullest.
This deck won in the Finals with 3VPs despite having Tzimisce wall as Prey and
Computer Hacking weenies as a Predator, no Crypt acceleration, multiple Master
cards getting canceled in the same turn by Sudden Reversals and a Life Boon
played for 5 on its Prey to prevent first oust. I think that removal of Pentex
Subversion and Parity Shift, that was recently announced, will just make this
deck stronger and a definite part of the Top 3 Tier one decks. And in the end,
a message to all the Walls sitting for 1hr 50mins and doing nothing - You're
gonna need a bigger bloat!
