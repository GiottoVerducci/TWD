-- 1GW5 + 3VP in final

Deck Name: My stick is better than bacon

Here is a quick report by the Winner of the event Niko Vanhatalo.

Just your average Ventrue grinder/stickmen with my own personal preferences

Finals were pretty brutal because every deck was a bleeder in some way or the
other and there was no clear winner even when it was down to 2 players.
Players from 1 to 5 were Petri with Anarch stealth bleeder, Jyrkkä with
Lasombra/Kiasyd stealth bleeder, Pauli with Ventrue grinder, me with my own
Ventrue grinder and Lasse with Legion and Legionnaire bleeder. My biggest
concern was my predator who played pretty much the same deck with like 90% of
the crypt being the same cards, but we were able to avoid unnecesary contesting
thanks to table talk. He still contested my Lodin later in the game but was
ousted pretty fast after that before any real damage to me was done.
