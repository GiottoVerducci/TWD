-- 1GW4.5 + 2.5VP in final

The seating in the final was !Ventrue grinder -> high cap Tremeres with Malgorzata
 -> Eurobrujahs -> HoS grinder -> Asanbonsams.

The !Ven grinder almost managed to oust the Tremeres, but got stuck with some useless
cards and got eliminated by the Asanbonsams close to the end of the final, the Tremeres
also fell a few moments later. In the very last seconds Arek went for the oust of the
Eurobrujah, but got deflected to the HoSs who were at two pool, attempted to bounce back
to the EBs, but the bounce was DIed and the Eurobrujahs got a single point for that.
