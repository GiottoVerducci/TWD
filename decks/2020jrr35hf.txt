-- 1GW4 + 3VP in final

Esa-Matti's Stanislava was on the first seed by clear margin but decided to
drop out as he was unsure if he had to leave in the middle of the game. Sad
times! But because of this Matias The Dark Horse got to the finals.

Seating in finals:
Tommi Hakomaa (Rebekka + Jost + Auspex + Presence) ->
Karri Malm (Corrupt Constructions) ->
Matias Frosterus (Ani Aus For featuring Trochomancy) ->
Tero Aalto (Tremere Big Cap) ->
Hannu Kokkonen (Old skool Lambach)

Some 75-90 minutes of minutes of preliminaries and Matias was ousted (at 100
minutes left on the clock he HAD said that "Ooops, I made a mistake. Now I've
lost." Which surprisingly turned out to be absolutely true in the end!

Then Hannu and shortly Karri followed suit.

The heads up started with 8 minutes on clock and ended 5 minutes later with 3
minutes on the clock with Tommi beating Tero.

Here is the deck list. It was same deck Tommi played in Finnish Nationals 2019 with 1 extra Pentex.
