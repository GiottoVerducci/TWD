Deck Name: The Family Celebrates Christmas

Classic Powerbleed deck, based on my TWD of the "Bleedfest".
Of course, this deck can be tweaked quite easily according to personal taste and metagame.
Changes I will take into consideration:
Replace Francesca with another copy of Gloria, and/or add a third copy of Isabel, since she is the best that 5 Pool can buy for this deck.
The Uncoiling should be in, unless players stop playing ally decks, and Narrow Minds was not of much use. Plus, a third copy of Delaying Tactics seems to be highly recommended.
