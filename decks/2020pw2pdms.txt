Deck Name: Unmada/Lutz Gods of the parlaments

Description: Do what you have to do.
Thanks to Moisés Ferrer Gallegos mentor, good player and a big friend.

Jordi Bestard and Matías Tugores thank you for give me good advices. Maybe I
should used Minion Tap instead Villeins.. Anyways We played a great final with
a lot of votes like Lasombra, stanislava, Nosferatu... A good day to remember
with a big community of Methuselahs.
