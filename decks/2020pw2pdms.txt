Description: Do what you have to do.
Thanks to Moisés Ferrer Gallegos mentor, good player and a big friend.

Jordi Bestard and Matías Tugores thank you for give me good advices. Maybe I
should used minion tap instead villeins.. Anyways We played a great final with
a lot of votes like lasombra, stanislava, Nosferatu... A good day to remember
with a big community of Methuselahs.
