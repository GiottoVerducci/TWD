-- 1GW4.5 + 3VP in final

Deck Name: Stanislava Vote/Bleed v1.6

Third tournament of our "Road to EC" series. The faith of the next event is
still unclear, as it is not known how the ongoing situation is going to
develop.

Great amount of players considering everything that is going on. Super tight
games all around, unexpectedly a lot of voting and not that much bleeders. One
of our players had to leave after the first round, due to personal reasons, but
we continued with 12 players!

Big thanks to Tommi, Antti and Jyri for coming to Joensuu all the way from
Helsinki area!

Finals Seating:
Aapo Järvelin (Al'Muntathir Black Hand Bleed) --> Tommi Hakomaa (Osebo Combat/Wall)
 --> Esa-Matti Smolander (Stanislava Vote&Bleed) --> Jyri Puhakka (Anson Guns)
 --> Antti Penttilä (Jacques Rouge + Baali Vote)
