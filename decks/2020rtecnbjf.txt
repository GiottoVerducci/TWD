Deck Name: Grinderi

Second tournament of our "Road to EC" series. Next event "Road to EC: Field
Training" will be held at the same location in Fantasiapelit Joensuu at
14.03.2020.

This time we had a great number of players once again! Special thanks to Pasi,
Ari and Pekka who came from Jyväskylä and to Lauri, Tero and Jyri who came from
Helsinki area to join us in the tournament!

This time the tournament meta was heavily bleed oriented, with most of the
players playing some kind of stealth & bleed deck, or big cap toolbox decks
capable of pressuring via huge bleeds with stealth and voting.

After the preliminary rounds were over, Ari Lensu (5th player on standings)
decided to drop from the finals, to not keep the rest of the Jyväskylä crew
stuck in Joensuu, and to get back on their way to home before midnight. Because
of that the 6th player, Simo Tiippana took his place in the finals.

Finals Seating:
Tero Aalto (Malgorzata) --> Aapo Järvelin (Ventrue Antitribu Grinder)
 --> Esa-Matti Smolander (Stanislava Vote & Bleed) --> Simo Tiippana (Ondine Combat/Wall)
 --> Jyri Puhakka (Ventrue Princes with Sticks)

I was expecting a bleed heavy meta in the tournament, so decided to play the
good old Grinder, the deck I started the game with. This version is pretty
basic, with some influence from Jyri Puhakka's version and thoughts, in
Retribution and some Crypt decisions. Landed on 3 Neighbor John, instead of 3
Blackhorse Tanner because of the lack of intercept in the deck. To compensate
that I added one Edward Neally to the deck, he has two really strong abilities,
even if they are a bit situational. To boost the hand cycling capabilities of
the deck even further I decided to try one Katherine Stoddard too, which was
great addition, as it basically won one round for me!
