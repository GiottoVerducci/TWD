Deck Name: Gotsdam Maris Eurayle

Basic idea was to look for vampires with very strong innate abilities that are fueled by blood, and then fill them up with a cheap Salubri.
The ones I picked are purely defensive, and then rely on a few key actions (spiritmarionette/heidelberg or anarchist uprising) to get ousts.
All cards need to be playable by at least two of the vampires (I only broke the rule recently when I added two Veil the Legions on the day of the tournament).
I initially just had one damaging vote, but every time I added one more, the deck got better.
Two of the telepathic misdirections could be my enemy's enemy for additional intercept opportunity,
but I really liked always being able to deflect no matter who is bleeding.
