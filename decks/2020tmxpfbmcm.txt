Deck Name: The COVID-20

Description: This is a deck based on the Shambling Hordes archetype. I have
built it by looking into many other decks, like the one that was done by "John
the Trader". Nowadays we are facing some Pandemic that is named COVID 19, and
since I want to make fun of it, I decided to name this deck after the virus but
increasing the number 19 to 20 because this decks has 20 Shambling Hordes. The
main idea is to awake all the Hordes you can as soon as possible, the more
zombies you would have the merrier you would become. Once the Zombies are
awaken they should need something to eat, so don't lose your time and send them
to feast for all the delicious preys served around the table.
