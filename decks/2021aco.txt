-- 3vp in the final

Deck Name: ——____—— aka The Hoody Gang #3
Description: Again big thanks to all. I tend to build several version of decks I enjoy playing, so here is another of my Matasuntha decks. The deck is super slow so not a very wise decision in a 100+ people tourney, especially without Smiling Jack, Anarch Revolt, etc. The worst part is you rely on the table collapsing and taking what is left. The good part is you have decent defense, in terms of intercept and even combat. Ashur Tablets to retrieve cards, combat when you face hard hitters or wakes & intercept on a stealthy table. 8 Eagle's Sight should provide you some control of the table.
