-- 2,5 VPs in the finals

Deck Name: Diptinatpa & co. Investigations
Description: I wanted to meme around with Demonic Possession and Archon Investigations, but it seems Dominate is strong. Long story short - we had a blast with 15 players in Eastern Finland for 2R+F, where everyone got well up to speed and warmed up known and trusted, safe, aggressive picks. Great fun, and something that bodes well for the re-establishing of the tournament scene post-Corona!

There's very little to say about the deck itself. Sometimes you get lucky and others make more mistakes than you. For 3R+F and a player base that's not short on practice after a a break, play control. Anu is cool though!

Dreams and Wakes are probably a wash in this particular build.
