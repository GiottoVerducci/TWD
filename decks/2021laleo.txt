-- 4vp in final

Deck Name: Ravnos Revolutionary Council v2.5
Description: Bleed and Vote toolbox built around Revolutionary Council and Week of Nightmares. The strategy here is to make the proper setup (Tumnimos, bleed supply, propagandas and titles) and staying alive long enough to finish the table in spectacular fashion. It's way more versatile and resilient to combat than the Kholo variant, but requires more time to become a real threat. On the other hand it can score a VP or disrupts the whole table literally out of the blue if your baron is ready and well supported.
