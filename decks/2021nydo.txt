-- 1GW4 + 3VP in final

Deck Name: Assamite swarm bleed and vote

I wasn’t sure day before the tournament if I have time to actually play,
but had already selected deck in case I manage to join. There is reason behind my choice of deck.
I’ve been doing lately a special project or kind of challenge of my own.
The challenge is pretty simple to get a game win with each clan, doesn’t matter what game.
Most will come in casual games more than likely, as I’m not gonna be usually that predictable
on the clan I’m playing in tournaments. This time I felt is safe, noone would know from start
that I actually am on Assamite on the challenge. So I chose to continue that on the tournament, and seems it paid out.
