1st seed with 3GW+10.5VP in preliminary rounds, 3VP in final.

Deck Name: Organized Bleed Resistance
Description:
The genesis of this deck was to show that when you generously add Earth Meld, PRO-DOM is stronger than OBF-DOM at the bleed game, offensively and defensively.

Great thanks to Tero Aalto for helping to Euro-charge my deck the night before by getting me to cut some cards, and---very importantly---adding Kuyen to the crypt.
Also thanks to Sérgio Martins for offering second opinions/counterpoints during that session so I stood my ground on the cutting where it counted.

Cheers to the other finalists, especially to Darby Keeney, who was a very good sport and coordinated not contesting vampires with me.

If I had to play this tournament over again versus the same opponents, I would remove an Organized Resistance or two, replace Donnybrook with a tenth Earth Meld, add a fifth Deep Ecology and make room for three or four copies of Groundfighting.
