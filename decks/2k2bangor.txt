Ben Peal

Go-Go-Goratrix

Description: Rush combat/intercept combat hybrid, taking advantage of
Goratrix's built-in strike, and superior Animalism and Dominate.
Payload comes from Goratrix's +1 bleed, and some Governs (used
typically for bringing out more minions). Cheap supporting minions
provide heavy Auspex defense and extra bleeding, and the 5-caps help
with both defense and protecting Goratrix.
