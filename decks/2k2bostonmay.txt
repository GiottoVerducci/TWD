Deck: Monster's Ball

I've had a very good record with this deck in casual games, and now in a
tournament. Its fairly straightforward, but a good bit of R&D went into
testing and tuning it. Intercept combat. A nice layered defense of solid
intercept (with an option to KO), light bounce, and Greta, mostly keeps
you out of trouble.

The Palla Grandes, with maybe help from Fame, give you a kicker to swoop
in on your prey, and oust (maybe with Aire as the closer). The deck has
enough juice to do this twice, but kind of runs out of ousting power after
that. But, typically, its just enough to win the table.

I started thinking about this deck after having my sneaky decks shut down
by intercept monsters in a few tournaments. Kind of -- If you can't beat
them, join them. Then give them a beating.
