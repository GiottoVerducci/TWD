Gabrin's Paradox
Description: Use Sense Dep on your predator to buy you breathing room.
If you prey's actions gain him pool (votes + voter captivation, fifth
tradition) or he rushes backwards, then sense dep him too if you can.
Try to wait until someone is ousted before you play Week of Nightmares
(Store it in an Annex until then). Playing the waiting game can be
effective. Oh yeah, always get Lazar first if you draw him in your
opening crypt. If your prey is playing big vampires he will definitely
be worth it. (Once, on turn 2, I had Lazar bleed with computer hacking,
freak drive, and steal one from my prey's big vampire)

Would drop Red Herring, Ignis Fatuus, Rapid Healing. Maybe could use
another Draba, another Sensory Deprivation. Clan Impersonation or Golconda
would be useful/funny ways to save or sacrifice Gabrin before the last
Nightmare counter is placed. Secure Haven might be a good addition to
protect Gabrin from rushes.
