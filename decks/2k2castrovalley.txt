Winning Deck Name: Of Ghastly Dreams (best safety lies in fear)
Description: Clearly toolbox, the core is "intercept". This deck had
been doing well in our casual games, so with some tuning, I thought it
might be an interesting candidate for playing in a tournament. After
tuning, I goldfished a bit and realized just how many of the actions
are at zero stealth. The lack of stealth remains a problem. Should
pull Fleecing, an Overload, and probably the Patshivs.
Pseudo-Blindness was a metagame guess that didn't work particularly
well (in that I discarded all of them). The MVP was Mass Reality;
should be more than one.
