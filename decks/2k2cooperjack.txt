Deck Name: Jacks Back Part 1

Description: Let the anarchy spread...

Completely untested (prior to the tournament), i would remove the
cats guidance and probably change the temptations to two more forms
of corruption. They were great with jack hitting your preys vampires
blood and then burning it when they were down to zero. An
interesting strategy, to just sit there, build up and then whack
jack on the table and just defend. Slightly random IE. Someone across
the table usually bought it from jacks effect, and is definitely
better to wait until your down a player as defending it against 4
other meths is NO FUN(tm).
