Deck Name: Gunslinging Varmints
Created by: Martin Cubberly, with help from 'The Boyz'

Description: Shoot things. A lot.

Having now played it, I reckon a few things should probably change.
Didn't see any use for the IR Goggles or the Waste Management (the
latter presumably because all the games were so quick, no one got near
the bottom of their library) but I did realise I didn't have enough
Rush. Often I was stuck with no way of getting into combat...
The intercept always came in handy, but without Wakes it meant it
effectively cost me a minion... Wonder if it could stand to loose
these as well...

God Bless the new Concealed Weapon though. What a beauty...
