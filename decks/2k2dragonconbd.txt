Deck Name: Yer Mom Don't Block

No real play notes -- this is a relatively stock Giovanni powerbleed.
The AVA was very convenient as nobody ever bothered to take the action to burn
it -- I'd have rather had a second one in the deck than the Mausoleum, which
got discarded a lot. Same with the Venetian Conference, as I was able to play
at least one to good effect in each round, including the final (to torporize a
hunting Suhailah). Many people are familiar with the +1 intercept from superior
Spectral Divination and will plan around it, so being able to have the +2 intercept
coming from Francesca was excellent. (This also let me save the Spectral Divination
for extra stealth.)

Description: Giovanni Seductive Telemarketer filth, tweaked up for an expected
Camarilla-heavy tournament with Venetian Conferences and Gillespi -- also shifted
around to be more Deflection-proof with no Conditionings and mostly
Scouting Mission/Bondings.
