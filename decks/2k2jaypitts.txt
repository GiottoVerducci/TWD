Crusade: Pittsburgh
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
December 14th 2002
10 players
Jay Kristoff

On 12/14/2002 Ira Fay hosted Crusade: Pittsburgh. Ten methusulaths
participated (Twice the number of participants in Ira's June 2001
tournament). Most of the players were locals, with travelers John
and Tom Mickle (from central PA), and myself (Jay from Columbus OH).
After two rounds and a final, my weenie Auspex deck came out on top.
If anyone who was there wants to recap some of the events of the day;
please do. For now I'll just post the deck.

Jay's weenie Auspex

This deck is based on Jason Dawson's (of Seattle) weenie Auspex deck.
It has been Jay-ified, however. This deck won a four player tournament
in Lansing MI in late October of 2002. I waited to post it until it won
at a larger (10 player) event:) The Sniper Rifles are great against close
combat. I oust people with a hoard of one bleeds or with Fame/Sniper Riffle.
I can afford Club Zombie because my vamps are cheap, and because it's hard
to oust me with all of the reaction cards and blockers.

PS: The day after the tournament my girlfriend and I flew from Pittsburgh to
New Orleans for vacation. Six days later Trent Rezner (of Nine Inch Nails)
was on our flight back to Pittsburgh. I wanted to give him a copy of Majesty
with the Nine Inch Nails quote on it. Unfortunately all I had on me were Cam.
edition Majesties (from the cool prize support from the Pittsburgh tourney)
with the bible quote. So, no Majesty for Trent.
