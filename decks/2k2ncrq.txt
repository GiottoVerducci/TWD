Deck Name: Bell's Bruise, Bleed, and Bloat Brujah

Description: I played nearly an identical version of this deck in the
storyline tournament at Anderson, IN. Major change from that deck was
I replaced Francois Villion with Anneke, with the idea of being able
to 2nd Tradition anywhere, she was too appealing to include in this

This deck is more along the "toolbox"-ish build than I usually prefer,
but it mainly relies on other Methuselahs thinking it is a dedicated
combat deck. For that reason alone I threw in a solitary Immortal
Grapple to assure people that I *might* have more in there.

Other than the Deflections, probably the game breaking card in the
deck is the Judgement: Camarilla Segregation. It never hit the table
during this tournament, but has proven in the past to be the
difference for me several times, especially when the table comes down
to 2 Methuselahs.
