Deck Name: When Keebler Elves go bad.

Was supposed to be a bruise and bleed but worked better as a
opportunity power stealth bleed with casual intercept combat.
Reason being is that at almost every table I sat at had more
intimidating combat such as, Grant's Animalism combat deck
and Ulysses' Assamite deck.
