I just got home from an amazing first day at Origins. I was able to
eak out a tournament victory with my Mirembe Rides Again deck. 25
meths played in this event. 4 of the 5 finalists were from Ohio, the
other was Halcyan2 who is from somewhere in Illinois.
I'm sure details on this and the other events will follow. It's
bed time for me, so here is the deck:
