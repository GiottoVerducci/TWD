Origins Friday

Well my luck continued on Friday at Origins this year. My other
Gangrel deck won that tournament. This deck is a beefed up version
of my Can I Wear This Jacket? deck that I used to win the Newark OH
storyline event www.geocities.com/vtesresults/semsith/newarkOH.htm)
I guess that the new beef comes from more combat options and more
damaging votes. Because the Gangrel are no longer in the Cam., I am
not sure how much longer I will be allowed to play decks like these.
It certainly was fun to play on Friday.
