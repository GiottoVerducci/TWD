I had a Gargoyles deck in development that had won 4 of 4 casual games,
including one where I lent it to someone, so I figured it was ready for
prime time. It consists of weenie Tremere 12, with Tremere Slaves
operating like the offensive line of an American football team, clearing
the way for the Tremere. As such, I've called it The O-Line. :)
The Tremere are just there for weenie bleeds, with the occasional
Conditioning or J.S. Simmons/Tasha Morgan, as well as Deflections.
The Gargoyles are Pot/For/Flight monsters, and they also handle the
bulk of the defense, with Razor Bats (which have proved surprisingly
handy) and Defenders of the Haven.
