"tzimisce - go: counterspell deck"

special thanks to jay kristoff, for his deck on thelasombra's site,
which was the inspiration for this one, and to david d'avila-anderson,
for his incredible articles on the subject of intercept-combat decks...
-- i've been playing this deck for over a year now, in various forms,
but it wasn't until bloodlines and 'read the winds' that i was able to
really get it off the ground... the raw power and efficiency of that
one card opened up so many card slots, which i was able to dedicate to
forward pressure, without compromising my ability to fend off 4-on-1
onslaughts turn after turn...
-- in light of the lessons i learned at this tournament, i think i'll
need to change the 2 anarch revolt to either 2 more smiling jack, or 2
war ghoul... the anarch revolts organize the table against me too much,
and turn my cross-table buddies into enemies... with smiling jack, they
at least think twice before coming at me... removing 2 revolts also
allows me to drop 2 of the eagle's sight, so maybe i'd go with 3 smiling
jack, 3 war ghoul, and exchange the femur of toomler for one more
revenant...
-- i'm seriously considering swapping out the duplicate caliban in the
crypt for either goratrix, matteus, omaya, or [most likely] jost
werner... the duplicate crypt draw doesn't really hurt me much, but
having jost's inherent stealth might make a big difference in some
games...
