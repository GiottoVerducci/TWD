The Nosferatu Hate You! (version 6.0)

The Delaying Tactics was my total prayer card, put in to hopefully avoid
getting Dramatic Upheavaled and having my VP stolen, but I never actually
played it this tournament. The Computer Hackings were a fairly recent
addition, and they were nothing but good--they sped up my ability to bleed,
often doubled as a Rush action, and could always be cycled. I'm thinking
about taking out the last two Decapitates for 2 more Hackings. And the Paul
DeCarlo? Yeah, sure he is just another 2 cap with pot, but between the hot
chick, cool suit, and looking like John Cale, he added nothing but class to
my deck.
