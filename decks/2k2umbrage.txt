Deck Name: Master Madness

Description: Getting as many master-phase-actions as possible. Empty
your vamps and don't be shy to use Rosslers speacial and Information
Highway together. Tap Anson, Golconda Anson (using his special to do so)
and bring a new Anson in play. The Baali can help with additional
master-phase actions.

Try avoiding trickling out your revolts as you'll need two or three in
one go to finish the game.

Golconda is also an offensive card. You're the only one who need large
vampires - the rest of the table can use the pool, especially your predator.

You win with the revolts and you need the massive bloat to make your
Life Boons count.

Even though it will eat on your nerves, to chose when to play without
any vampires at all is definitely what changes a loss to a win. On
average I'll sit close to a third of any given game without any
controlled minions.

Votes are a problem, as is any weenie-predator.

68 Mastercards is a bit low, and I think one each of Obedience,
Wake and Deflection could go. I'd also remove Legendary Vampire.
Replace with three Archon Investigation and one Tension in the
Ranks. Maybe also replace one Information Highway and one The
Barrens with two Dreams of the Sphinx.
