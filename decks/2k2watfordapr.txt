Deck Name: The Turd

A real abomination of a deck, constructed initially taking advantage
of Anneke's brilliant special to control the table but evolving into
something much nastier. Interestingly I only had to use her special
twice on the day and both of those times were in the final and saved
VP's from dropping to someone else (not an acceptable situation:o).
A evil VP sniper of a deck that puts the table under constant
pressure and drops atom bombs with alarming regularity. The sleazy
2nd trad / Obedience (hmmm I do like the picture on Sabbat
Obedience:o))) / Majesty combo allows you to stay untapped and
block loads of actions. In the second round I was under serious
pressure from Matt Stockton's weenie Pre deck and was pleased with the
constant ability to block 5/6/7 weenies a turn whilst laying down the
master phase bombs.
