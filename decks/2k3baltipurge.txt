Baltimore Purge
Glen Burnie, Maryland
February 8th 2003
15 players
Dan Keller

Deck Name: Guns Don't Kill People, Vampires Do

Dan Keller of Washington, DC was declared the winner with 1.5 victory
points in the Finals of the Baltimore Purge VTES Tournament February 8,
2003. The game went to time after 16-turns. Survivors of the final
(in order) with 0.5VP each, were: Jason Babbit of Manassas, VA; Greg
Williams of Elkton, MD; and Blake Stewart of Hanover, MD. Josh Duffin
of Bethesda, MD made an early exit (ouch!) in the finals after
finishing the preliminaries with the highest ranking.

The tournament was held at Games and Comics
and Stuff in Beautiful
Downtown Glen Burnie, MD. Fifteen Methuselahs came from Virginia,
Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. to play and grab a copy of
the Wind Dance promo card.

Description: Nosferatu Anti-Gun Combat/Toolbox

Comments: I created this deck in response to the growing regularity of
guns in our local (Washington, DC) play environment. The Thrown Gates
were a recent addition to the deck, and I found during the course of
play that the DOtBs were pretty much useless when I could strike at
long range. So I will probably dump the DOtB's. Patagia will probably
go too.
