"Camille & Raven's Royal Bash"

This deck is based upon a deck I used to play before NRA rules were
introduced. When DS was first released force of will added to freak
drive, day operation, movement of the slow body & a rapid healing or
two, was just insane. To compensate for the "limited" number of bleed
actions being performed, some of the rapid healing/Force of wills
have been replaced by dominate cards.
