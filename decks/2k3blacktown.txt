AP League Round 1
Blacktown, Sydney, Australia
August 9th 2003
12 players
Chris Kellahan

Deck Name: Created Dominion v1.1

This won me a 12 player tournament on the 9th of August 2003 (AP League
round 1), held in Blacktown, Sydney. 3 rounds plus final. 1GW and 6
vps had me ranked 2nd going into the finals. I'd only seen 2 of the
other 4 decks during the prelims, and so i chose to sit between the
two unknowns (well, i sat as the predator of the deck i had heard was
a setite dominate stealth bleed, so it wasn't totally unknown). Marty
(1st going into the finals with a Kiasyd bleed deck) sat as my grand
predator. In the final i got 4VP and the GW. Marty got the other vp.

Description: Weenie dominate swarm bleed with Create Gargoyles.
