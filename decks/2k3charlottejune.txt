Deck Name: So Long, and Thanks For all the Fish

Timing is key for this deck. Park the Week under a Storage Annex until
the time is right. Bleed lightly but consistently during the early and
midgame. I tend to play recklessly and get out the fourth minion the turn
before I plan to pop the Week. By then, you ought to have a few +1 bleed
toys in play, and I have reliably hit one-turn bleeds of 12-16. Gabrin's
"other white meat" special, Nightmare Curses, and Red Herrings are very
useful for getting your prey's minions all tapped out just prior to the
wave of death. There's no hit back to the deck, but most people expect it
from the Ravnos, so work this early game on tables that don't know your
deck. You do have thirteen cards of "you can't touch this", though, so
don't be too afraid of blocking or being rushed (Grapple is, of course, a
bitch).
