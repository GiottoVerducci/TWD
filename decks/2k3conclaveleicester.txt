'All your beast are belong to us'

The whole vote deck module thing seems to be working. The Gathers
worked well, the Zillah's were quite bad in this deck due to Ingrid's
special ability. They would be better as Dreams to give a bit of
acceleration in the early game and see more of the deck as the game
progresses.
