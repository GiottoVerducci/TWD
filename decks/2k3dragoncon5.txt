Deck Name: The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Deck

Description: Based on Ethan Burrow's prototype, which used Hungry Coyote and
the Sabbat trifle, except that I didn't have any Hungry Coyotes, so I choose
the Anarch route. Hesha is the deck's star player, helping you bloat for 2
or 3 per turn. Greta and Jost Enchant down and handle the bulk of the auspex
defense. Try to give Kyoko the Unlicensed Taxicab if you can so that she can
hunt for extra blood (via Hospital Food) at +2 stealth. Important: save the
Direct Interventions for Dramatic Upheaval, Kindred Restructure, and Protect
Thine Own. Props to Andreas Nusser for suggeting Form of Corruption -
it causes your prey to slow down and not get away from you while you're
building up.
