Deck Name: Anarch Revolt (Mixed Clans)

Description: This Anarch Revolt deck is extremely nasty and
aggressive. The key to its success is to get The Parthenon, Anson,
and Rumors of Gehenna into play as soon as possible. With them in
play, you will have 3 master phase actions and be able to quickly use
the many master cards that are in this deck. This deck will make all
players lose pool every turn. And with the many Dominate bleed cards,
along with Misdirection, Seduction, and The Sleeping Mind, you will be
able to bleed your prey and ensure that he or she is the first player
to be ousted.
