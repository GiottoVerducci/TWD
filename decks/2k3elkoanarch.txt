Deck Name: Bleeding Fags

Well, the cards were chosen out of neccessity, since I do not have the
extensive card collections SOME people have *Glares at Brian*. The
basic strategy was to intercept as many actions from my prey as I
could, then bleed the snot out of them when he is tapped out,
preferably using someone with Pulse of the Canaille on them. Should
my prey still have blockers when it happens to be my turn, that is
were the Strike: Combat Ends combat cards help out, as well as when
everybody decides I need to leave the table, and start salmon swimming
towards me. If I had the cards that I would have prefered in the
deck, I would have swapped out the Putreficatioins for Majesties, but
I only had 4 of them, and Putrefications did work (I guess no one uses
them for the Presence ability but me). I would have also added Eagle's
Sight, to intercept annoying votes that wasn't called by my Pred/Prey.

I had alot of luck during the Tournament, being able to get Jost in
the 1st four on three of the four matches, so he happened to be my big
bad bleeder, as well as having a combat deck as my predator the
majority of times, which helped me out since I was able to draw my
S:CE cards as they drew Rushes and the like. All in all, I really do
not have many complaints about my own deck, since it did work
according to my plans. I guess I could complain about the fact that
the crypt capacity average was higher than I wished it to be, but
looking at the Elder Library database, there wasn't many I wished to
add. Sometimes the deck wasn't cycling cards fast enough, but that is
something that could have been remedied at the time.
