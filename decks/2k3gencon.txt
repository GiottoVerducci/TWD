This deck originally contained an Erichtho instead of Kij, a Rumor Mill
instead of the 2nd Pentex Subversion, and a Redirection instead of the
2nd Magic of the Smith. Each of these was changed the night before the
tournament, and each was important in one game or another. I came to
PRAISE Pentex throughout the tournament--especially in the finals when
I used it as a 2 pool Misdirection to screw my prey's Sheila Mezarin and
unload a hand full of bleed on poor Forrest for the oust. My strategy in
seating was to sit opposite Jay, because experience has shown him to be
a good cross table ally, and indeed without his help (read: Powerbase)
I would very likely have been ousted.

Since Jay and I had identical records going into the final round
(8vp 2tw 2nd place), LSJ had to flip a coin to determine our rank--so,
I am this year's winner because I called "heads". Clearly Jay Kristoff
is an excellent player and deserves this title every bit as much as I.
