Deck Name: CE Firepower

Description: Camarilla Edition version of an older tournament winner
based on Toreadors with Obfuscate.

Disguise out big guns, block and torporize while tasting back blood
for later bloat. The deck is very expensive to play so Parity Shift
with a couple of token stealth-cards is there to help you get back in
business. There's just enough rush to keep players wary of you, but
count on having to spend at least three turns doing nothing while
bloating.
