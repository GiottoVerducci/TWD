Deck Name: Garou by Night

Description: Anyone who says Garou are not worth 5 pool haven't seen
this deck. This deck has played in tournaments all over North
America, its earliest viable version can be found on Seattle's
Qualifier page for 2002. A constant work in progress that began to
show people that memories was broken, but it isn't as I have proven
to myself. Drop the suddens, put in DI, add more delaying, Ancilla
Empowerment can do 15 damage to you no problem in this deck so
BEWARE!! Good luck, if you play the deck or want advice on how to,
let me know, it isn't as easy as it looks, you can kill yourself very
very quickly. Great Lakes Qualifier was 45 people. doros@umich.edu
