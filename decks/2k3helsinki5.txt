"The Nosferatu Is Your Friend!"
(aka. Nosferatu- A Gate Too Far)

Since the library has practically no cards that give additional votes
(except the Elysium) it is essential to get as many votes into play as
possible - with big Minion Taps it's not uncommon at all to have 8-9
votes in the late game (Harrod, Nikolaus, Sheldon, e.g.), which is
usually enough to pass a referendum. In combat, the deck relies
heavily on maneuvers gained from Thrown Gates and Swallowed by the
Nights. In case the opponent seems to be able to handle long-range
combat as well, the deck has some light damage-prevention. In general,
though, it is best not to block actions/bleeds from combat-heavy
decks, but rather to try to bloat quickly with Minion Taps and Parity
Shifts.

The deck placed second in Crusade: Helsinki IV, and first in Crusade:
Helsinki V
