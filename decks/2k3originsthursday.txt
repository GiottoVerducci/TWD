Deck Name: Fairies 'R Us

This is basically an all-around sneak & bleed but bash 'em if they block you
deck. On the first round, I worked all the way through my cards two turns
before the end of the game, so it's a good thing I decided to throw in enough
cards to bring the deck to 90. The final saw me entombing the majority of my
predator's vamps and sneaking through the defenses of my prey to eventually
pump a bleed and take him out. One thing I'd do to make it more effective
would be to put in another Tension or two, and to figure out some way to handle
the immortal grapple decks a wee bit better.
