Deck Name: Lies and Obfuscations (aka Your Government)

Description: Use the PRE obf vamps to call charming lobbies with
bewitching orations and voter caps. Use the obf vamps to call the
next vote, or piggyback another charming lobby with a pre obf vamp.
Get permanent votes as quickly as possible. Generally don't bother
blocking, as you shouldl be gaining a lot during your turn.

The Protected Resources should help a lot, however I found I often
had to burn them to get the edge or to bleed because I didn't have
votes or my votes wouldn't have passed. So obviously the deck needs
some work, particularly with the new voting system of the Anarch set.
