MOTTO: Coming soon to a school board near you.

Notes:

DO NOT SCARE THE TABLE... if at all convenient.

Get out Arika... burn people for fun and profit.
Profit is Minion Tap/Voter Cap. Use the Governs
to bring out friends for Arika. Relies on Zillah's
to outrun Combat Decks to a vampire, who can then be
burned with PTO, and fails utterly to weenie combat,
fast big combat, Camarilla combat, and any of the same
if it's bleed.

This deck came into being preNERFing of 5th Tradition.
I put it together to see if I could still get big
vamp bloat to work. I managed to guess the local
metagame to a T on the sect issues required to play
the deck. Only one deck I saw was all Camarilla.

Changes: Some GtU to Mind Rape, 3 Lucinde 2 Vitel
lots more combat D/bleed D depending on metagame.
I've added all the Awe's I own, more may be good.
