Deck Name: Spying Mission

Description: Obfuscate bleeder based on Spying Mission with some
bleed and combatdefence.
A rather hefty bloatenginge for this type of deck.
Play this and get rushed. A bleeder is a bleeder even if it looks
a bit different from the standard ones, and as such it is really
awfully boring to play. Tap out with everything unless a deflection
isn't paired with a wake.
