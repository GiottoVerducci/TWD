Deck Name: Gangrel

Wanting to play a deck without bounce, my eye fell on Gangrel royalty.
This is what i made of it. After the tournament I would scratch the
Raven Spies, Succubus Club, Fifth Traditions, Fourth Traditions, and
add in a few more Restorations. Legendary vampire is really a great
card for this deck.
