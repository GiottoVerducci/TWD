Deck Name: Break Stuff - 1st place Columbus, OH 1-11-03

Description: Switched out a bit of the combat and some of the
reactions for more Computer Hackings. It gave the deck more teeth as
far as pool reduction, however there were too many combats where I had
to exchange "hands for 1" with my opponent.
