"Gentleness"

The deck is called "Gentleness" based on my Jyhad philosophy that
goes, "The gentle Methuselah is the successful Methuselah". The deck
is "gentle" because it comes out slowly and lets the game develop
around it. Much like Jay plays most of the time. Combat is based
around Silvia blowing beads off of less-combat capable vampires. Zack
and Chester are backups who provide crypt-draw variety. It "cheats"
in terms of combat in that it uses Skin of Steel for protection only
in the basic. This is bad for two reasons. One, I normally am weak
against celerity combat. Two, I can't use SoS when Silvia or others
are empty. Hence, the Giant's Blood and Tastes.
