Deck Name: Die Kuchenfrau goes mad

Description: someone has stolen rachel's sneakers (or something).
Probably your prey. She wants it back. By killing. Bleed, oust, win.
Victoria is "great" with the network, which is broken. Earth meld is
broken too. Add some candy just for fun like Sniper Rifle, Ivory Bow
and Aarons Feeding Razor. You don't need the madness network /
homonolucus combo to win, though it make things more easy. Cards that
also would fit in are probably gigants blood and Curse of Nitocris.
Muddled vampire hunter is great to make players leave the network
alone, one more would be good. The only problem for this deck is
immortal grapple, but no one ever plays it around here so... in an
more grappling environment I would add Claws of the Dead and
Rötschreck. Or some more Sniper Rifles.
