Deck Name: Laz-Man Standing

Lazverinus is the star of the show. His job is to take out opposing
minions using multi-rush/Freak Drive to do multiple actions per turn
for lots of damage and rapid card cycling. This clears the way for the
support team to bleed my prey.

With Laz's +2 Strength I can have a combat deck with very few
do-damage cards (only 7) and focus more on picking fights, surviving
them, and beating combat defense. Lazverinus isn't stopped by
Obedience and Grapple-punch for 3-press-punch for 3 again takes most
minions down.

The deck had great flow and played very well on Sat.

Another things I like about this deck is that I finally found a way to
get Political Ally to work.
