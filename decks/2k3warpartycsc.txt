Deck Name: Lasombra Governing

Description: This deck won the War Party: Charleston, South Carolina
tournament on April 26th, 2003. There were 14 players, two rounds and
a final. This deck took game wins all three rounds.

The deck was designed to get out a larger Lasombra with superior
dominate, who would then use Govern the Unaligned and Scouting Mission
to bring out the other vampires in the crypt. I always got at least
one vampire for free this way.

This deck was the Lasombra Commons deck that I won a tournament in Los
Angeles with a few years ago, but that got bumped up to 89 cards where
the original was 73 cards. There was also supposed to be a hunting
ground in the deck, but I forgot to add it in.

In the Charleston event, I took 4vp, 2.5VP, and then 3VP in the
finals.
