Deck Name: Call 666 B-E-A-S-T

Description: Call up the Great Beast, give him VICISSITUDE TEMPORIS and
OBEAH and let the good times roll. Ideal opening hand is Minion tap,
Vicissitude skill card a call the great beast and lost in crowds/Domain
of Evernight. Bring out Huitzopochtli use his special to gain another
master phase so you can Minion Tap and put a skill card on him and hope
theres not massive intercept around...

... this was an evolution of the mid 70 card version i included in the
Great Beast *ahem* newsletter but found that i kept running out of
cards. Boosted the defence and bloat side of the deck and it seemed to
flow well in the 2nd and 3rd rounds, only stuttering in the final and
the first round (when bleeding James and his Mobile Intercept
Vehicle...:)
Still managed 3GW and 11VP in total on the day, so not tooooo shabby for
a Baali deck...(chortle)
