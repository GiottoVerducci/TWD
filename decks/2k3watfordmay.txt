Deck Name: Brick in a sock

Description: Ummmm... pretty obvious bleed or rush with lots of Pot
minions. Use Computer Hacks to force blocks or bleed for steady twos.
Bring back diab'ed minions with Hand of Conrad. Use Tributes as soon
as you get them, don't be afraid to Tribute to empty cos most of
minions can use Hungry Coyote when you get it to fill back up. Change
of Targets draw out wakes etc and make the deck a tiny bit faster and
much more annoying by adding to the total number of actions possible.
Ivory Bow is in mainly to contest because its about the most common
'worst single thing' you can come across and is pretty useful on its
own. Two non-pot Sabbat weenies are there to make up numbers, would do
without and go down to twelve but have run out of crypt a few times
which is no fun.

Also was a bit of an experiment on a few different levels. Has put my
mind to rest that a weenie pot Sabbat Embrace is indeed missed deck
opportunity #23 **sigh**

Wanted to try a version with a lot of solid masters and it worked
pretty well - what you lose in cycling you more than make up for in
pool gain so that works for me. A lot of the masters (18 assuming a
minion is out) are playable 'out of the box' so you don't often have
them sat in your hand... which is nice.

A goodly amount of pool gen for a Pot deck and two AI's coupled with
numbers backrushTM makes for a pretty resilient Pot horde that keeps
on coming.

Anyway enough crap here is 'Brick in a sock'
