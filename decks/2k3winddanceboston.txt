Second Guess Corral

It's hardly the most original deck - it's based on Colin Riggs'
winning deck from a recent DC tournament. I just didn't like
the fact that its only defensive option is to go upstream, so
I dropped a few Bum's Rushes and the Computer Hackings and
Arsons, and put in some wakes, bleed bounce/reduction, and light
intercept. It didn't run very consistently, and I think 9 or 10
guns and 9 or 10 Concealed Weapons may be the way to go, as I
had some difficulty getting a gun early on in a couple games.
Some of the consistency problems were likely the result of the
increased number of fight decks and reduced number of bleed decks,
reducing the effectiveness of the defense. The intercept did
prove to be quite handy.

Here's Colin Riggs' deck, for comparison:

Thank to all who showed up! It was great to see the turnout!
