Deck Name: Yojimbo

Description: Get out a couple of minis and Karsh then go to town. Hit
predator hard if needed then watch the table carefully and pick your
targets, use your rushes wisely and get a cannon as soon as possible
to give you options and to conserve combat cards if you need to. Save
Beast Meld to get a Rifle or to guarantee downing a primary target if
you already have one.

Deck gets trucking on only 12-13 expenditure and really kicks-off
after you have a piece. Use Karsh's in-built rush to cycle into
essential cards and don't worry too much about losing the one point
buddies. Bleeding the Vine won me a round and Secure Haven the final,
they are essential tech. Bleeding the Vine is an amazingly powerful

I think in hindsight I might try and find room for one more rush and
one more Freak, deck is tight though. Built first to take down other
combat decks, it seems to handle tourneys quite nicely as well. I had
a great time torporing waves of minions with it. Karsh is a madman.
That is all.
