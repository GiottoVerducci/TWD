Deck Name: Kitties

Description: Put in play a gargoyle and a tremere. put in play as many cats
as posible, and use all those slave tricks and vis/tha cards. Most of the
time, via charisma and soul of the earth, the rock cats hit the table for
free. Armor of terra-daring the dawn also grants a fair posibility to put
them in play.
