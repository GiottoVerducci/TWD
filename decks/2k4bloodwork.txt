Deck Name: (she's got the) east side blues

Description: Doesn't like weenies or rushes, but when Arika performs
4+ actions on her first turn, the table swings to your advantage.
Hidden strength is good vs Aid/Carrion, Trap, Grapple and can even be
used offensivly in late game. Cloaks are good for stolen minions. PTO
worked fine, but wasn't gamewinning. You can get votes by robbing
other titles, if needed.
