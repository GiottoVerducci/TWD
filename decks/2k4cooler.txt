"My Deck is Cooler Than Yours!"
Weenie Obfuscate Cooler Bloat

A Blood Doll/Cooler bloat deck I have been working on for a while (and
failed to get anywhere significant at the NE Reigonals this past
February with) that Jon Darbro convinced me to play at this
tournament. The Perfectionists turned out to be incredibly useful (who
woulda thought...), but the last minute inclusion of Specialization
didn't really help much--it would have been better off as, well,
pretty much anything (maybe a Zoning Board to get rid of locations?)
