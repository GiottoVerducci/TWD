Deck Name: Uglier Jack

Comments: A very slight tweak to my Ugly Jack deck featured in the
!Nos newsletter a few months back. I swapped out Calebos for a second
Teresita and Unburdening the Bestial Soul for Anachronism, which went
in mainly to deal with the pair of players (if not more) I correctly
guessed would be playing with Assault Rifles. Never played it, but I
was gratified that I had guessed the meta-game correctly. I had meant
to swap out Tock for Nigel the Shunned and forgot to. Picked up 3GW
and 9VP, then won the finals with a lot of luck in the timing.
