Vote Nos 2004
Jay Kristoff won this tournament handily with 4vp in the final. I
believe that he had 2 game wins going in.

There are too many masters thanks to some last minute card additions.
The Rampage really ought to be an Arson, but Rampage is so much
cooler. I never got to use Destructive Secrets, but I think it would
be quite good in an end game. The deck can wrestle for vote control
with the "I (re)vote my Nos Justicar, it passes easily, Cryptic Rider,
Praxis Seizure" trick. I had fun stealing Living Manse and Palatial
Estate with Disputed Territory. Club Zombie's intercept is meant to be
given to Embraces to block nasty actions, or it's just an expensive
hunting ground. When the deck is up and running well, it tends to lots
of vamps and pool. Special thanks to Will Kristoff, Nick Smith, and
Mark Loughman for loaning me cards to complete my deck.
