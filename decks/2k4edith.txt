Deck Name: Settite Legal V4.0
Created by: Lance Shope

3 Game wins and 12VP.
When I went in to the tourney, I was looking for something that would
take advantage of the Boston metagame. I borrowed a deck idea from
Lance Shope, and we discussed how to modify it to make it work in the
environment we anticipated. The delaying tactics and archon
investigation were vital for dealing with the plethora of vote and
bleed decks that day. The deck also had enough bloat that could
survive without any bounce.

Description: Obf bleed with Legal Manipulation. Majesty if you get
intercepted. Use the temptations on your own vampires if they run
low on blood. They can Legal Manipulate (cost one blood) then Tempt
self to hunt and gain the blood back. Or Tempt opponent's vampires
(standard).
