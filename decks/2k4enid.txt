Beast Want Hug

The deck is going to pretty much stay the same as above, although I'm
probably going to take out the Undead Strengths. They usually wind up
being superfluous as I'm already doing 3+ hand damage with Signpost
and 1-2 points from Crows. The Decapitate is usually just in there as
icing, too, so it might move out for something better.

Weaknesses: If my prey is exceedingly ranged-based, then I'm screwed.
I was considering putting in three or four Stunt Cycles to help deal
with decks that prefer to fight from a distance. However, a ranged
deck as my predator is not so bad considering Guard Dogs give me 6
more Maneuvers.

Up-stream Play: A lot of people frown at me when I go upstream in the
early game, but I've found it's key to playing this deck effectively.
One turn spent crippling my predator means I have nearly one oust's-
worth of mostly forward action I can apply to my prey. I've been
trying to teach myself "when enough is enough," but sometimes I've
punched somebody into torpor when I should've just left them at 0
blood. Fight decks aren't just mindless obliteration - rather than a
messy dirty bomb, you have to be a precision tactical nuke.

Anyway, enjoy.
