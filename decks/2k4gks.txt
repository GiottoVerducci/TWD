Deck Name: Ruptura Interior

Description: A derange deck that has been in my mind since the new
reword on derange. I finally got all the deranges I needed and I put
it together and played it on our february tourney here in gothenburg.
It took 1GW and 7.5VP in the qualifying rounds in a 19 people
tourney, it then took the gw with 3VP's in the final round.
Combating Cailean: block/kill, Giovanni: pot/rush, Setite:
sb/enticement and Etrius: powerbleed.
The idea is to take it easy, try to be friendly even if you put
Leandro in play. Play deranges and wait for the right movement. When
a majority of the table is turning malk. Then steal the vamps. Minion
tap them, Golconda them, Burn them with PTO and prevent them from
killing you with obedience. Use all the broken cards you can think of
and win. It requires a great deal of thinking and some dealing but
it always takes vp and it usually takes gw's too.
