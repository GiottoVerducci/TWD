Deck Name: The Guests

Description: Inspired by the Leonard Cohen song "the Guests"... A
neo-stealth/bleed with a nice twist of gehenna. Get one or two VP's and
then play Absimilard's Army and wait for a while. If anyone who isn't
you takes a ghoul, steal it with your merged Sebastian.
Since the numbers of masters are quite low, the Veil of Darkness hits
everyone else harder than you.
