Vendetta: The Battle for the Harrisburg Hat

Trey Morita

Deck Name: Moncada's Army

Description: Lasombra votey-bleedy stuff. Always get your
biggest vampire first (yes, that's usually Moncada) and use
superior Governs to hoist the rest of the crypt up. You can
get away with having no wakes because of the Creation Rites
babies who sit around untapped with Dominate and Moncada's
special ability. The Fortitude masters are for the real
vampires, not the babies (I don't actually expect to make
more than 4 babies tops so that's why only 4 Dom masters)
but they could probably be replaced by Bewitching Orations
or Voter Captivations or anything else useful. Maybe D.I.
for those cursed Protect Thine Owns.
