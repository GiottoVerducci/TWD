Deck Name: Ravnarchs

Deck Concept (aka "what's this piece of crap?"):
Get permanent resources out, go anarch, become barons, call votes,
bleed at stealth, wreck people's day with Week Of Nightmares
foolishness, make combat cry by using dodge, strike: Combat ends, and
prevention, and other assorted toolboxy goodness.
