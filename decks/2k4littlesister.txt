Little Sister

Description: 	This deck is actually not my own. I forgot to bring
a deck to a tournament and borrowed this one. The primary creator is
my little sister, Keiko Düring, and after that the deck has been heavily
modified by her boyfriend, Max Widen, Beatrice Düring, my wife, and myself.

Bleed, rush, beat the crap out of anything that stands in the way and
pray that you don't encounter aggravated damage.

The deck has a surprisingly powerful bloat-engine as well - something
that is much needed as it intercepts very little and bounces not at all.
