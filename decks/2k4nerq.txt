Deck Name: Semi-Responsible Bleed

the basic idea is somewhat responsible sneak and bleed with slightly
more defense than an all out S&B deck might have, since they're all
mid-cap vampires. Le Dinh Tho (i'd add a third of him if i owned
another) takes the first action every turn to get rid of deflections,
wake, intercept and other nastiness. get at least little obf on him if
you can to make sure he can get his inherent action off. additionally,
the change of targets and spying missions are there to make sure you
don't bleed your grandprey too much. CoT is also good for drawing out
wakes from your prey. I'd replace the dodges with absorb the minds if
i owned them, since everyone in the crypt has dom. i'd also
consider putting in a fragment of the book of nod. i stole one during
one game and it really helped card flow. the kindred restructure is a
prayer card and might be better as a dramatic upheaval so anyone could play it.

that's mostly it. govern down for pool gain and more minions,
especially early. the more actions you can take, the better. have fun!
