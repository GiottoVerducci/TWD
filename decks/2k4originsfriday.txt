Beefcake Blocks!

The deck was designed for a more bleedy atmoshpere than this
tournament turned out to be. Even so, it held up well. Lots of cool,
permanent resources, and a nice assortment of previously proven
cards. Nothing ground-breaking here. We already knew that the
Erciyes Fragment is good; add the fact that Beefcake can play many
of the most popular tournament skills, and it gets really strong.
I think this is my first tournament winning deck to use dominate.
It took several showers before I felt clean following this win:)
