Deck Name: the Trickstars

Judge: Ginés Quiñonero (Damnans)

Description: This deck was inspired by not a few comments on this newsgroup
about how Anthelios can be abused. Decided to build and paly this deck on
saturday at friday's evening, and built it at 6 in the morning once I
arrived home after a few drinks with some friends. Some cards were missing,
somehow I lost the Art of Love and not a few events should go in, but I
wanted to play it in order to see if, for one time, the theory matches
reality. Will rewrite it this week, as definitely some form of permanent
bleed is necessary.

the point is: with Anthelios in play, you can add casual but definitive
master cards that won't be needed each game but that will be a nice addition
in an attrition deck like this. Cards that forgot to include (but obviously
are a must) are Cultivated Blood Shortage, a Sudden, a Direct Intervention
and Vox Domini, and obviously downgrade the number of card to 75. Some other
events are to go in, like The Slow Withering and Blood Weakens, just to
increase the effect of Wormwood.
