Deck Name: Erase Me (V4.0)

Here is my winning deck. In this tournament, I've met more political decks than
I've ever seen in a single tourney and most of them were built using big-cap vamps.
This, of course, was to my advantage, since killing a big-cap cripples someone terribly.

Description: Derange vamps, give them some much-needed Dementia and have them climb the Social Ladder.
