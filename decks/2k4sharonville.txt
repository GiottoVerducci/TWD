Muaziz's Emancipation Proclamation

(90)


highlights:
-Moving the retainers around with Heidelberg Castle.
It can provide multiple plus bleeds, and multiple rushes
with Stone Dog and Razor Bats.
-Darning the Dawn and not going to torpor with Armor of Terra.
-Multiple Blood Dolls on Muaziz + Disarm/Bow Gargoyle combat
+ Muaziz unchecked Diablerie = pool.
-Evoking the Slave rule when Muaziz gets blocked.
-Saying "Ublo-Satha" in Jabba the Hut voice all day long.


Thanks to Corey Brindley for some deck testing advice.
Charnas the Imp should have been in the deck, but I forgot about him.
Also, when Gehenna becomes legal, some of the damage prevention
will change to Soak because of its synergy with Armor of Terra.
