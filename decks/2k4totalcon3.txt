Deck Name: Pochtli Twister

Description: I was wondering about building a deck that was less than
60 cards - and padding it out with burn option cards - to see if there
was potential for abuse (withdrawal excepted). At least from this
experiment, there's no abuse to be found, but it's a fun deck to play.
The Tracker's Marks were specifically chosen because they're red and
thereby easy to spot in your hand, helping you to not forget to
discard during other players' untap phases. I strongly suggest
making room for a third Telepathic Counter. The idea for the deck
comes from a deck (called Pochtli Twister) built by one of our local
guys - Keith Page - a couple years ago, before Bloodlines was
released. He stopped playing a while back, but I figured I'd revive
the idea.
