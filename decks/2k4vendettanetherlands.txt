Deck Name: Thrown Junk & Sexy Tricks (TM)

This deck doesn't really need a lot of description; it's full forward
motion CEL/pot combat with a few sexy tricks (credit goes to Peter
Bakija). It has decent bloat and small minions, so having 4 or 5 out
is not uncommon. Bleeding for 4-5 a turn is something very few decks
can deal with, so it ousts fairly fast as well.

Since some people asked why I added that last part to the name, so here it is:
Sexy Trick #1: The Waste Management Operation / Al's Army Apparatus shuffle tech
Sexy Trick #2: The lone Contract
Sexy Trick #3: The Fast Hands
