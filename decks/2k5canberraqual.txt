Deck Name: Bleed Like Me, Responsibly

Not quite weenie OBF AUS DEM. Concept was to bleed for 2 or 3 each turn and
avoid stealth jam but still have enough of it if need be; thus most of the
stealth served a dual purpose. Reality was never enough DEM in the opening
crypt and rarely enough AUS for the counters to work effectively. By the time
I got to the finals I knew that I had to go digging for the AUS or I was toast
against my Malk! predator. I had to cycle like a bastard to oust Claudio to win
and learned that Misdirection is worth its weight in gold (hang on, a single
library card doesnt weigh very much), ok more. Midget was my vampire of choice
on the day as my prey in both the third game and the finals was packing raven spies.
Nor did I regret packing 16 Telepathic Counters as they are eminently cyclable
and manage to consistently frustrate, with only one card, my predator.
My sympathies to Salem who because of his irresponsible bleeding ultimately
gave me the game win in game 3 due to a pass the parcel bleed for 5 at 3 stealth!
Cheers Telepathic Misdirection.
