Deck Name: Pesadilla Vud√∫ (Woodoo Nightmare)

Description: Bring out Shambling Hordes, play Temptations on vampires
controlled by another Methuselah, and keep alive until you have a
decent setup. This deck is very weak if your predator is very aggressive from
the beginning of the game. If you successfully set up, then you get an interesting
control of the table. The Khobar Towers allow you to gain 3 pool when your
Shambling Hordes have 1 life left. It is also interesting to use the Towers
when you also have the Heidelberg Castle in play and you put a vampire in play,
since it allows you to move all his blood to another vampire you control and
remove him from the game afterward for pool gain.
