Deck Name: Dangerously Cheesy

Description: Weenies seize Praxis and call damaging votes. Hilarity ensues.

The deck could be 60 cards, but I was worried about Nightmare Upon
Nightmares, so padded it.

In blessed perfection, you seize praxis with as many minions as possible
on turn 2, and then lay into the damaging votes, continuing to seize
praxis with new minions as the oppurtunity presents itself. You can
never have too many princes, since they tend to live very, very short lives.
