The idea is to appear non-threatening, shut down power-setup decks
early, have staying power, and slowly build for the swarm bleed.
The non-threatening part is fairly easy to see; the deck has no
power combos nor dangerous-looking vampires whatsoever, and all of
the anarch revolts have been phased out.

The absence of oft-repeating cards becomes apparent to seasoned
opponents fairly quickly, allowing for surprise while at the same
time appearing non-relentless and thus not scary. Shutting down
cheesy power-setups is something in which I take great delight,
especially in tournaments, and nothing is better for that than
to bring out a first-turn vamp with intercept and combat capability.
This aspect of the deck was particularly useful in this tournament,
allowing me to stop Adam from getting his allies out (in a deck that's
frightfully powerful when it gets going,) and keeping me from getting
rolled over by a presence-weenie bleed deck, which, I've heard, had
dealt 14 pool damage in a previous round before its prey ever got
out a vamp.

As for staying power, most of the vampires are small enough that the
deck's pool gain can almost keep pace with the cost of its minions
past the first few -- plus, it's an intercept deck, with blockers to
spare. What gives the deck its teeth (other than swarm potential) is
that in combat, the auspex weenies almost always deal a little more
damage than is expected. Weighted walking sticks, lucky blows and pulled
fangs may seem newbie-ish, but how often do you anticipate Franciscus
to deal four damage in a single round? That surprise factor is what
motivated this version of the deck, along with a cost-benefit theory:
if your vampires are dealing out more damage than their capacity,
you're probably winning.
