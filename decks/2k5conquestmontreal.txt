Ventrue Power!

This deck is geared around Arika and Marcus Vitel. It is quite slow to
start but once it gets going it is hard to stop. Since Dramatic
Upheaval and Kindred Restructure were made illegal in tournaments the
deck has weakened but it is still quite powerful. It is quite
vulnerable to combat decks and those who start quickly such as B/S and
weenie decks. The Freak Drives make-up for the size of the vamps by
allowing for many actions per turn.This deck deals quite well with
intercept decks.
