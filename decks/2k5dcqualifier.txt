Deck Name: Now For the Main Event - Zombies!!!

Description: Overwhelm the table with your need for tasty brains.

Pretty obvious choices here. Le Dinh Tho was a last-minute
substitution for a 3rd Isabel. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have won
without him.

Yet again I make my deck too big. This should've been in the 70-80 card range.
I never came close to running out of cards and there were certainly
some key cards I wanted to draw.

Pretty standard "don't block me" package. Could've been more cards,
but since the action starts at 1 stealth (2 with Andrea), this was
sufficient. I used the Spectral Divinations for intercept more than
once.

These events worked out very well. I was lucky in drawing them early
every round. Dragonbound helped me gain almost every VP all day. Six
cards in hand is plenty for a Horde deck since I don't rely on any
combat combos. Unmasking was discarded in round 3, but was critical in
round 2 and the final. FBI Special Affairs Division is just huge. It
makes a Horde with 1 life very useful indeed. I actually didn't rack
up very many counters on it. It mostly served as a deterrant.

I had meant to replace 3 Deflections with Redirections to save blood,
but I forgot. Don't know if that would've made a difference. The
bounce was crucial in round 2 and the final but useless in rounds 1 and
3. Only played Poison Pill once and it didn't change the outcome of
the referendum. I keep trying with this card, but I've yet to have any
positive outcome. The only nice thing is the Hordes can play it.

Library (90 cards)
Master (17)
2x Acquired Ventrue Assets -- Great card for this deck.
1x Barrens, The -- Got it early in almost every round.
2x Blood Doll -- I'm something of a Blood Doll addict, so it was kind of scary playing with only two of them. Worked out well, though.
1x Charisma
1x Creepshow Casino -- Never really needed it, but I didn't face heavy intercept.
1x Dreams of the Sphinx -- Gave me a turn 2 Andrea twice.
2x Fame -- Can't live without it.
1x Giant's Blood -- Played it right before Oscar was going to play his in the finals.
1x Jake Washington -- Great with Unmasking + FBI or just eat him for the blood.
1x KRCG News Radio -- Never needed it.
1x Morgue Hunting Ground
1x Path of Bone, The -- This was nice, but not crucial.
1x Perfectionist
1x Specialization -- I was surprised, but I hardly got any use out of this at all. I figured in a deck with 18 of the same card, this would be a killer. It ended up being practically useless.

Action (8)
1x Far Mastery -- Stole a Procurer in the 3rd round.
7x Govern the Unaligned -- Used both ways. This ended up being a good number.

Ally (20)
2x Leonardo, Mortician -- He's better than Procurer. Don't even try to tell me otherwise!
18x Shambling Hordes -- Good number!
