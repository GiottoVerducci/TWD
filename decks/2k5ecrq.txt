Deck Name: Nevermore

Description: This deck started as an experiment in defending against
stealth-bleed decks without the aid of bleed bounce. The idea is to
get out obf-ani weenies, who then employ lots of Raven Spies. You
can't expect to block everything (especially early on, when you're
most vulnerable), but your predator will end up having to spend a lot
of stealth cards to get each action to succeed, to the point where
their hand will be stripped of sufficient stealth after one action
and they'll have to wait until they draw more stealth before making
another run. In the meantime, you can recoup any pool lost by
farming from Blood Dolls. You're also looking to get bleed retainers
and Sniper Rifles, as well as additional weenies. You eventually oust
your prey with weenie bleeds.
