Deck Name: Matthias & Pals

Notes:
I have no idea why I did not have Erciyes Fragments, but I will
definately put them in for future use. I also think Matthias could
benefit from a Rack. The deck is a little tricky, since Matthias runs
out of blood too quickly which makes your minion taps on your other
minions harder to do more effectively,
