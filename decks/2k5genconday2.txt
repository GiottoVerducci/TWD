The North American Championship was won by Peter Charnley of
Ann Arbor, Michigan with his Arika and Friends deck that got
him to the finals last year as well. The Final was very
exciting to watch and went all the way to the time limit.

"The deck is designed to run in spurts. Whether off the bat or later
in the game some turns will be spent doing nothing, waiting for the
opportunity to cycle reactions and combat cards, other turns will
consist of vote, freak, bleed, freak, etc. One advantage of the deck
that some people have keyed on is the lack of permanents to make the
deck appear frightening. With three vampires out, most people are only
afraid of Arika, and then only because of her text, PTO ability and +2
bleed. Very rarely do people worry about the cloaks, or the extra
actions with freak drives and majesty. I've been playing and tweaking
this deck since I started seriously playing Vampire, almost 3 years
now, so this deck is as good as it gets. Modifications consist only of
2-4 card swap outs based on metagame, more or less combat, stealth,
vote bump cards depending. I went with 12 combat and 8 stealth instead
of a previous 10 and 6 because of KMW's combat, and the number of times
intercept has kicked my butt. The 8 stealth card setup is probably going
to stay, but in a less combat-heavy environment, 1 majesty and 1 rolling
would get swapped for other cards. Oh also, I like the lack of wakes.
People often times will behave as though I have a wake in my hands for
deflections when I don't. Thanks to all those 'responsible' bleeders
out there:)" - Peter Charnley
