Deck Name: Nergal has possesed the body of Thetmes
Created by: Johannes Walch/Erol Hammer

Description: Erol lent the deck to me and I added 2 D.I
Hard to play yet very powerful. You don't have many combat cards but
you must look dangerous all the time. Every move is crucial. Only rush
sure targets/easy kills.
