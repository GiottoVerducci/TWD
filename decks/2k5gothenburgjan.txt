-- 5VP in final

Deck Name: The White House

Description: Created by Alex Ek and Erik Torstensson.
Won the tournament in Gothenburg on the 8 January, 2005. It took 1GW,
The idea is to lock down the table with your first traditions, then
pay for your turns and try to get a lower pool than your prey. Then
Parity Shift the pool back. If you can't get lower, then just use
your other damage dealing votes to oust.
