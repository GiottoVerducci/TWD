True Love and Loyalty

Just an attempt to do block denial while avoiding Necrobleed.
Originally used Kahina and Khaytall with added Pulse and Seduction but
found it too slow off the mark. As with all block denial speed helps
enormously as most damage is done early. Possible advantages over
standard Necrobleed include tapping with Faceless Night and a chance
to cancel bounce with Approximation. True Love's Face followed by
Elder Impersonation is always fun !
