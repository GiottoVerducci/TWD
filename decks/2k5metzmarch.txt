Metz Tournament
Metz, France
March 13th 2005
21 players
Sébastien Varrette

Deck Name: Corine has a changeling tongue

Simple toolbox tzimisce, clearly oriented toward bleed thanks to
Fiendish Tongue (marvellous card for the clan) and changeling.
The bleed potential of the deck is often under-estimated and the
fear of the War Ghoul (that will never appear:-)) can be exploited.
The femur is ideal for Corin, which is the star of the deck (it can
run without her but its +1 strength is really valuable).
For the rest, intercept and Rötshreck cleverly.
[Private note]: in the final, Horatio proved again that he's really
a incredible vampire as its revenant and its Ivory Bow used to be
the terror for my prey. Feel the power of Horatio!!
