Deck Name: Anarch Diversion
Created by: Sven Helmer (inspired by Kevin Scribner's Anarchs Deck)

Description: Toolboxy Anarch Deck with lots of Diversions

When I visited the Boston playgroup in spring 2004 and played a game
with Kevin Scribner, I was impressed by his Anarch deck featuring
lots of diversions and decided to build one myself. The deck is a
little bit slow, but once it gets going it's really fun to play.

Powerbase:LA is a strong addition to this deck. Discarding your
surplus Galaric's Legacies and untapping vampires by doing so is
really nice. In my attempt to get down the number of cards I threw
out too many Weighted Walking Sticks (should have been more),
especially after replacing some with Zip guns (I had some trouble with
ranged combat decks before adding Zip guns, as my Magnums were always
blocked). Reformation wasn't too great (only played it once,
unsuccessfully). I also had trouble drawing into my Blood Dolls, maybe
I should add one more (and/or throw out some more cards).
