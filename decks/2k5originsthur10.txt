BEN'S DECK NOTES:
I'd been thinking about building a War Ghoul deck for a while, but
acquiring the 10 of them that one needs for the usual 60-card version
looked to be a pain in the neck. So, I thought about applying the
tech developed with the Pochtli Twister deck, building a version that
was 30 or so cards, with half the War Ghouls, and padding out the deck
with burn option cards. This would save me from having to get more
War Ghouls, and I figured that it'd be extremely rare that an ally
rush decks would bring out 6 or more such allies anyway. When Mata
Hari was printed, I decided to build the deck, as she could take easy
advantage of Waste Management Operation and I liked the superior
Obfuscate. Josh Feuerstein then clued me into the fact that the
burn option cards could be D'habi Revenants, as they can be discarded
via burn option, and Mata Hari could employ them for use in creating
War Ghouls (though not for the bleed bonus). I ran with the idea
and included a variety of other burn option cards, such as Riddle
Phantastique and Chanjelin Ward. The deck proved to be highly
effective, the only worry being that Mata Hari might get immediately
rushed via Red List when she comes out, before a Secure Haven or
Chanjelin Ward could be put on her. As such I recommend dropping
a couple Obfuscate stealth cards and including a couple copies of
Mirror Image. Another discovery was how solid it was to bring back
Jake Washington via the Waste Management Operation, as it allows
you to stop one rushing minion cold every turn. Props to Josh
Feuerstein for the D'habi Revenant idea, and to Ruben Vidana Ramos
and Stephane Lavrut whose War Ghoul decks I used as references
(and to Lasombra Jeff for the TWD Archive!).
