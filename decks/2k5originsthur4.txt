Deck Name: Henry Twister

BEN'S DECK NOTES:
Around the time I was contemplating the EconoGhoul deck, I got into a
conversation on the #vtes irc channel (irc.sorcery.net) with David
Cherryholmes and others about Henry Taylor, and how obnoxious it can
be to put a Protean skill card on him and playing Earth Meld to protect
a Smiling Jack. This seemed like a great application of the Pochtli
Twister tech, so I decided to build the deck. I used Dirty Contracts
instead of Tracker's Marks, and included a Brothers Grimm, as the Dirty
Contracts could be used to protect the Brothers Grimm. Ruins of Villers
Abbey, Belgium and Quick Meld are in there for combat defense, as they're
extremely card-efficient sources of maneuvers (and the maneuvers from the
Ruins can be paid for with The Rack). Millicent Smith is there to slow
the rate of table progression down, while speeding up the rate of turns,
helping to buy clock time for the Smiling Jack to work. I don't recommend
using such a deck in a casual game. As much as there are assorted ways of
defeating this deck (Pentex Subersion, Immortal Grapple, Kiss of Ra, etc.),
if the table doesn't have a way of getting past Henry, you'll be wasting
2 hours of their time as they get to sit there and do nothing. That's fine
for a tournament, but not fine for a friendly game. Props again to Keith
Page, a former Boston player who built the original Pochtli Twister deck,
of which my Pochtli Twister deck is its namesake, and Henry Twister is
similarly named in its honor.
