Deck Name: Mage Power

Description: Weenie ally swarm using one of the most versatile ally in
the game. Put out a couple vamps, recruit like crazy and start the
onslaught. Once the recruiting is done, the vamps are here mostly to
hunt and bloat with the blood dolls or bounce bleeds and block
unharmful vampires. The rest is all done by the nephandi and Ossian
(who can be a real beast with Memories + Trap). Since you only have to
spend about 8-10 pools for vamps, you can afford to recruit about 4 or
5 allies and still have a decent pool cushion. The deck fears
intercept and the creepshow is often not enough, but you can bait them
out if you have multiple nephandus in your hand and try to slip one
by. Heavy combat is bad as well, which the Québec metagame is full of,
but the Memories help a lot here, hence the high number of
them in the deck; just remember that Carrion Crows are your worst
enemy (about 1 deck out of 3 played those during the tournament, so
I'm surprised I managed to do that well).
