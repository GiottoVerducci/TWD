Deck Name: It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.

Description: A very fun and challenging deck to play. Expect to have
the whole table turn against you once you've dropped down a couple
Gehenna cards. Wins by painfully slow attrition. In the mid-game,
you should have gotten rid of all your vampires (eat them with Gregory,
or diablerize them yourself), so the nastiest events won't affect you.
Then you can play Dragonbound for the oust (initial bleeds by your
weenies, and then later Mylan and Gregory will help as well).
