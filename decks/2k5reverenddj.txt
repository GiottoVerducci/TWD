Sheldon 3.0 Newark Redux

Mark's comments:
The same basic combat monster I've been running with a few new twists.
Archon and Alastor votes for permanent rush worked well, same with the
weapons, either with the Alastor or without. Nightmare upon nightmare
was put in as a 'screw' vs breeder decks but was never an issue and
may be replaced. The lone telepathic misdirection is for that third
point of unexpected intercept of that surprise bounce of a big bleed,
but is rarely of much use and could probably become another rush or
Second. The standing votes the crypt provides, and Nikolaus's special
to get them out quicker and cheaper are two of the most important
elements of the deck. If nothing else, the combat module allows one
to make one's presence felt at a table.
