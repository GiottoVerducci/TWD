Deck Name: Buckets o' Money

Description: Basically a Group 3-4 Ventrue version of the Lasombra
Creation Boon deck, using 3rd Trads instead of Creation Rites and
Ventrue Headquarters instead of Power Structure. Marcus Vitel's
retainer-burning ability was invaluable in the tournament. This
is now the second tournament I've won with a deck that was the
result of a conversation with Sten During (the previous deck was
Pochtli Twister).
