Deck Name: Calling Demented Voters

Description: Combat defense? Who needs combat defense? Vote push?
That's for wimps. Stealth? That's for people who want successful
actions. I built this one in the hopes that the amount of stealth
could handle even heavy intercept decks (Forgotten/Elder being the main way
to do so). I was also obviously hoping not to be rushed. I got really
lucky in that regard as I never sat next to a rush deck, but many times I had
a predator who couldn't go forward due to a lack of minions. In fact,
in both the first round and the final I rescued my predator from torpor
several times to keep the ol' meatshield alive (I'm lucky nobody ever
decided to cut the middle man and rush me directly).

Looking at the deck, one might wonder how this or that card worked out.
Most of the time, I couldn't tell you. I've recently developed this
extremely minimalist playing style where I'll play like 20 cards all
game. The deck is 90 cards by force of habit, but I never even came close to
playing that many. I guess it worked out okay this time, but it
would've been nice to see the Jake, Gambit Accepted, Momentum's Edge, etc.
Never got a chance to play any of those.

This tournament was two preliminary rounds and a final. I got 4VP at
the first table as I couldn't prop my predator up long enough to get the
sweep. Then I swept my second table to get top seed on the finals. I
made the obvious choice to sit away from the combat decks at the table.
I spent much of the game trying to keep my predator alive so I wouldn't
get rushed by Euro-Brujah. Then I drew the 3 KRCs I needed to oust my prey
just after the Euro-Brujah ran out of steam and died. My new prey, a
!Nos rush deck, very nearly got his second VP for the win, but I was saved
by the two hour time limit.
