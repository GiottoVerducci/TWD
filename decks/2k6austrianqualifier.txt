Title: Kyasid toolbox bleed
Description: The package seemed to be perfect for the day.
Quincy came in very handy in the final rouns because of the Imbued.
In retrospect I would leave the library as is. I would tighten the
crypt with two Tupdogs though taking out Banjoko and one Roderick
Phillips March.
