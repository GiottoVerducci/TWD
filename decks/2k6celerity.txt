Deck Name: Troll Bridge Quiz

Description: Toreador Bleed deck.
My prey was an Inner Circle Deck in the final, played by Simeon Nagel.
So, I had a lot of good discards in the Croc's Tongues. The
Antediluvian Awakening played by James "Grimm" Nault and his 2 cap
weenie Sabbat with 46 Ascendance deck helped to keep the game to a
tidy hour of play. Jon Sushenski, a very welcome addition to Atlanta
these days, was playing an Intercepting Malk Croc tongue deck that was
having the same trouble with me that I was having with my Inner Circle
prey and figured it was best to back bleed and oust his weenie sabbat
pred, Grimm. Mike Perlman got James' VP with his
temptation-bleed-you-dead-Setites. Simeon got Mikes' VP a short time
later and I was able to clean up getting Sim and Jon. Lucky day.
