Deck Name: Team Amaravati

Description: Looking at Amaravati, I was inspired by Lasombra Jeff's
Lasombra Creation Boon deck. Amaravati plays Governs to get out more
guys. Guys get out Web of Knives Recruits. Weenie bleeding and
Govern bleeding commence, backed up with KRCs via massive vote push
from Amaravati's special. Con Boons for either defense or more guys.
35 stealth might seem like a lot (ok, it's a lot), but currently
there's a lot of permanent intercept out there chewing up the stealth
of vamps with inferior Obfuscate. Alamut isn't critical due to
Amaravati's special, but it's a plus when you get it (same for Ventrue
Headquarters). This is also a good deck for a player on a budget, as
the only expensive card in there is Direct Intervention (and one could
replace it with a Yoruba Shrine or something).
