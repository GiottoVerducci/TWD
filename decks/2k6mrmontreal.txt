Ventrue Power II

This is a deck that I have been working on for a few years now...
I've played many version of it but I like this one... It obviously
revolves around Arika and Marcus, the freak drives make-up for the
size of the vamps and don't be shy to use the governs for bloat or
to bring-up the support cast.
