Deck Name: Ayo Stuffs the Ballot Box

Description: Gain massive vote dominance with Ayo's special. Vote at 5
stealth or more. Gain pool. Kill.

Good crypt draws all day. I think all my minions saw play at one point
or another. The cel/for is only for Forced March, so I don't need all
my minions to have that. The ones without obf can just sit around
giving me votes if I have intercept to contend with. Although Ubende
is really good in this deck, I only want one copy because I don't want
to have to double anyone other than Ayo.

Stole a Reanimated Corpse in round 1 and a Procurer in round 2. I
would've liked to have another and maybe some more bleed, but couldn't
find room.

The intention here is to get past casual intercept and occasionally
break a wall. I was imagining a Strange Day Banishment on Howler or
something like that, but I never actually had to deal with much
intercept. I lowballed the vote push because of the strength of
titles. Since Ayo has inferior obfuscate, I play one of each obf
card, plus the Uncontrolled Impulses, Forgotten Labyrinths and Forced
Marches. That could add up to a lot of stealth.

I didn't get the Kholos all that often, but they aren't that important.
Scalpel Tongue is a great card. I didn't have to use it defensively,
but it's still nice to have. I originally had Telepathic Vote
Counting, but I think Scalpel Tongue is a stronger card here.

No room for strong combat defense. These were mostly in case I get
blocked, not if I got rushed.

Most of these cards were important at one point or another. I sort of
wanted to put in an Obfuscate skill card for Ayo, but couldn't think of
what to take out. I never played the Pentex. That was put in for
wall-busting only. I don't imagine this deck could defend it well.

Heavy payload here. Could probably drop one each of Eldest Command
Undeath and Secret Must be Kept. I haven't gotten a lot of use out of
those. Banishment was very important to my 2nd round victory.

Just enough bounce/intercept to keep my predator guessing.
