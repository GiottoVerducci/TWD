Deck Name: Hmm... Yeah I'll Block That (a.k.a. Ol' Big Eye)

I figured to see the Imbued at Origins, and of course being a qualifier,
figured to see a quite a lot of Stealth/Bleed and Stealth/Vote. This deck
gives me a ton of flexibility on which actions happen at the table. I was
able to negotiate some short-term deals by simply *not* Eagle's Sight
blocking a few times. I die horribly to combat, particularly the animalism
variety - which two decks in the finals were running. My only hope was for
them to wreck each other, which eventually did happen.
