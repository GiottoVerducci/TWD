Deck Name: 2006_06_25_all_powerful

Here's the list as played - it was intended to be a 90-card deck
but one of the React with Convictions apparently fell out before
I started the tournament, so I played it at 89 cards that day.

This deck was inspired substantially by Matt Morgan's Defender-based
Imbued deck, with lots of blocking and, of course, Rejuvenate. This
version, though, came from the idea of putting in at least some of all
the cool-looking Powers to see which ones were really worth playing
with; those took the place of some other things that might have been
useful, like Sport Bikes...
