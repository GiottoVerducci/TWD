Deck Name: Howler and Friends

Description: This is a fairly toolboxy wall deck, getting out assorted
allies and retainers, with Howler minding the fort. A few years ago,
Andreas Nusser clued me in to the power of Form of Corruption for keeping
your prey in check if you're a slowly developing deck, and it works to great
effect here, and the Neighborhood Watch Commanders can really take their toll.
Over the course of the tournament at Origins, I managed to steal Arika twice!
