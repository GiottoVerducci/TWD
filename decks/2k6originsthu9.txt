Deck Name: Lasombra Creation Boon

Description: This deck was directly inspired by Jeff "The Lasombra"
Thompson's Lasombra decks that took advantage of breed, Power Structure, and Consanguineous Boon:

I built my own version quite some time ago, but while it did very well in casual games,
it never quite got it going in a tournament. After my tournament wins with a Ventrue
version (Buckets o' Money) and an Assamite version (Team Amaravati) of the same concept,
I came to the conclusion that I needed to get rid of the Obtenebration in the deck and
exclusively use Obfuscate for stealth, since Obfuscate stealth is free. Angelica,
Gratiano, and Guido have Obfuscate, making this a solid plan. The deck worked like
a charm, getting 4GW.
