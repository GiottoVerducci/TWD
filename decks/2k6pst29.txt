Praxis Seizure XXIX: Turku
Turku, Finland

-- 1GW5 + 3VP in final

Deck Name: "Xaviar's Meat Packing and Storage"

Concept: Xaviar multirush with Pander support

Deck could really use more Dog Packs and maybe 1 or 2 Shadow of the
Beast. After the tournament I realised that it had just enough cards so
that my library wouldn't exhaust itself in the end-game, so cutting the
library down wouldn't be such a good idea unless deck would be altered
to be more permanent-oriented (having more permanent intecept and
perhaps Metro Underground or the like)
