Deck Name: Bitch Fight 3: the Return of the Bitch

Description from Anthony:
This is the same deck that I made and played to victory in the
Nergal Bath 2005 storyline event, also this was played by Hugh
at the NAC and he took it to victory (changing a fame for a
raven spy) and then the UK nats.. so 3 tournies and 3 wins for
what is a pretty innocuous deck.. probably one of the reasons it
does pretty well:)
