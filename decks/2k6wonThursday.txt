Go ahead and block this!

This deck was inspired by a deck by Robert Scythe that I had seen on
the Vtes in L.A Website. I wondered if it was as strong as it seemed,
I tweaked it a bit and never played it, I was planning to play it in
casual play... I entered last minute in this tourney and decided to
try it... It obviously needs more tweeking but I had a blast playing
it!
