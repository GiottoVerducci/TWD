-- 4VP in final

Deck Name: Angellore (Live In LA)

This is a modified version of the deck I used to win the 2007 Origins
qualifier. I chose this version of breed-boon for the 2007 NAC (and
EC) because of its anti-ally capabilities, its combat defense, its
surprise lunge capability, and its strong vote lock/push. I dropped
the 2 Enchant Kindred in favor of more Entrancements and another
Direct Intervention. I changed a Consanguineous Boon into an
Autarkis Persecution and 2 Kine Resources Contested into 2
Conservative Agitations as a defense against Delaying Tactics. I
dropped the 2 Change of Target and the 1 Crusade: Philadelphia
since I wasn't getting much use out of them. In their place, I added
an event package of Absimiliard's Army, Break the Code, and The
Uncoiling. Absimiliard's Army isn't in there for the synergy with
Entrancement (though it's nice), but is instead intended as a defense
against rush combat. This paid off in Round 2 of the 2007 NAC,
when I had Norm Brown's Basilia deck as a predator. Again, Siren's
Lure is a devastating card. It can change a run of the mill "bleed
for 1 to get the edge" turn into an ousting lunge. To answer a
frequently-asked question, I don't use Ensemble because it's just
asking to be bounced, leaving me to spend the next turn hunting with
everyone.
