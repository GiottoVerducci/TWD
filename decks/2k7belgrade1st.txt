Deck Name: Salubri getting dirty
Created by: ResurrectioN

Notes on deck:
The main reason i've picked to play with this deck was that i was
pretty sure what every player is gonna play.
My predictions came true and of 10 participants only 3 didn't have for
or dom in their crypt (note that 5 players who didn't show up would
play dom or for).

The dack itself needs some tweaking and these are potential changes:
-Perefctionst/ +Secure Haven
-Renewed Vigor/ +Conditioning
-Kiss of Ra/ +Dawn Operation

I have never influenced Blanche and she will probably be replaced with
Samson and Lana Bucher.
