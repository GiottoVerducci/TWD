Deck Name: We are the world

Description: This deck is a wake up call to the world to how powerful
the Guhuri are (hence the deck name) - people in our playgroup hardly
play this clan. The deck is very simple, it ignores the bad mix of
disciplines (I do not think potence mixes well with the dominant
Laibon clan) and tries to correct the clan's weakness: the absence of
stealth (which is easily corrected with the addition of abombwe trifle
discipline). Uses all the best Laibon and Guhuri cards, cycles super
fast and bloats well.

The main advantage of this deck is the fact that it is not a clan with
a bad rep so you get away with powerful bleeds and votes without too
much retaliation. Could use a bit of permaintercept (like a shaman)
and more permanent titles. The crypt could do with less doubling of
certain vampires - you'll get 4 vampires out per game.

Basically forget potence and discover abombwe... You'll fall in love
with this clan !
