Deck Name: Tribal Trouble

Description: This is a fairly straight forward stealth vote deck using
the Ishtarri plus a few friends. Ayo Igoli is team captain what with her
obfuscate, farming* capability and exponential vote gain. Ousting power is
supplied by KRC, farming courtesy of Voter Cap/Minion Tap and a few ‘in case'
extras thrown in (e.g. The Secret must be Kept for the Imbued factor).

*Note: In South Africa we use the term 'farm' instead of 'bloat'.
