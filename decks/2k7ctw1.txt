Deck Name: Tribute to Jay

Description: I used to think that !Ven sucked (how can
they oust with no stealth?!), but then I was inspired byJay Kristoff

here:

I've been playing a version of this deck since then. This
deck was also top seed going into the finals at the NAC
2006 Shadow Twin tournament. The Crocodile Tongues were
the MVP, getting by Carlton several times, and once by a
tooled up Joaquin Murietta with 1 blood. I intended to
include a Giant's Blood, but didn't find one before the
tournament. Govern at DOM + Freak Drive + Scouting at DOM = fun.
