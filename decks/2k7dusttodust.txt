Deck Name: [Lasombra] Turbo Lucita

Description: Put the soul gem on Lucita ASAP, she's a 8 cap, untap
with freak drive (costs 1 blood). Employ camarilla vitae slave (costs
2 blood, now lucita is a 9 cap), untap with freak drive (costs 1 blood).
Perform Embrace (costs 2 blood). With 2 blood left on her, and tapped,
Lucita perfomrs Force of Will (cost 1 blood), and plays conditioning
(cost 1 blood). Now lucita has zero blood, and takes 2 aggravated damage,
which burn her, triggering soul gem. A new copy of lucita enters play,
and inherits the gem. She is a pretty new and different vamp from the
one that has burned before, so she can bleed again, recruit another slave, etc...

Combo-breed-bleed.

Deadly, and hard to play.
