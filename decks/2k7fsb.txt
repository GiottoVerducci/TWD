Deck Name: Dog Soldiers

Description: I've had several versions of this deck over the years
with Gangrel bloating plus Garous with Assault Rifles being the
consistent theme. Previous iterations used multiple large cap
Gangrel, but this time I went for a star + weenies deck and added
a couple of Alastor and PTO for that extra hardcore tournament goodness.
