Deck Name: Imperial March

This is a kinda Power Tools deck. It's toolboxy with a bunch of power
cards with a focus on Celerity and Fortitude - combination with which
I am overly fond and have done to death at this point. It's got enough
combat to dominate non-fighty decks and hold its own against very
fighty decks. It's a serious vote presence at the table, lots of
intercept, and some "big" actions to try and throw down. And some
Imbued for pool mop-up and other duties as assigned.
