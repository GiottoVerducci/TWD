Deck Name: The Slow Withering

When I built this deck I had in mind something that could righteously
stop vampires, that could interfere with their hunting in particular
and with their actions generally. The intercept generated by Second
Sight and by The Unmasking, coupled with Discern and Sport's Bike,
is generally enough to really hamper a Methuselah's plans. Add to that
Determine and Champion and you really start to piss other players off.
The trick is, though, to apply it all in such a fashion that you don't
end up turning the whole table against you - crucial when you're trying
to bring out a hefty ten event cards that restrict all other players on
the table, except of course yourself, and those few other Imbued players
out there. Once those event cards start hitting the table it is very hard
for Methuselah's to generate the same kind of staying power that an
Imbued deck can muster. Add to that some bleed, and some fight, and
the deck can pretty much wear down anything. It's not to say that the
deck doesn't have it's weaknesses, or that it can't be taken down, it
most certainly can, but they are weaknesses for other players to discover
and, in my favour, of course, is the fact that the Imbued still remain
relatively understudied by most.
