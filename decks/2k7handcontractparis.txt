Deck Name: Back from Torpor

description: This deck won the "Hand Contract", 23 players, Paris,
May 26th 2007. Since Imbued aren't popular, might as well draw table
hate with Events and see what happens. Irresponsible deflecting on
grandpredator is nice too. The "hasty, untested tweaks in the morning"
were the poison pill/vox domini, heart of nizchetus, forschritt
library, glancing blow and were definitely useful. Don't leave home
without'em.
