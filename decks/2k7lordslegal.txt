Deck Name: Black Hand CEL

Description:	The deck is yet another testament to my love for Black
Hand, even without using the neat new cards of wonderfulness for Black Hand.
This deck focuses on attrition using Zip Guns/Blur/Taste. Let's
be honest: Zip Guns are not the most wonderful weapon ever,
but the idea is to simply survive combat until the end game.
Then, maneuvers are extremely powerful, and selective torporing
will balance the table into a win. There is a subtle but
important blood denial strategy that I feel stays nicely under
the radar. Generally the tables were unaware of the danger
until it was too late. Thuggees, Vampiric Disease, Restricted
Vitae, Strained Vitae Supply, Vessel, and moderate combat all
work well together to present a solid package for that purpose.
My own worries are handled by Zip Guns (to avoid disease),
Weeping Stone, and Corporeal Reservoirs.

Special mention of Vampiric Disease: it was a key card to victory
in both the final and two rounds beforehand. I love Vessel; it
should have a big impact once people forget about vessel and
play more blood dolls again.

The deck definitely carries weaknesses against animalism combat
or bigger guns. You have to make sure that you handle these
decks by talking them off the table or targeting their weakness.
For larger guns, pool is often a problem. Hone in on that. For
decks with animalism, there is a limit to how many times they
can repeat their schtick. Focus on killing one guy at a time.
With +2/+3 intercept plus permanents, you should be able to
manage it. Your "defense" against combat ends is that no one
is hurting you. That's benefit enough. Eventually they will run
out and they will be low on blood to boot. And if you get that
Vampiric Disease. . . . .

I would totally cut the single Art of Memory for a Reunion Kamut.
I just couldn't find one at the time.
