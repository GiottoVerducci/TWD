Steve's Inner Circle Deck
Description: He used dirty dirty PTO to blow
up his initial prey's Persephone Tar-Annis before she got to take
an action in the finals, then slightly later, his grandprey's
Lady Zara Slatikov. Not bad for two actions and two blood.
Too bad he didn't get to use a really overpowered card like
Voter Captivation at the same time. :-)

Steve's comments: The key to making this stealth vote/bleed work is to
get two Inner Circle members in play. It is most vulnerable to rush
decks and decks where the prey has both lots of intercept and combat
