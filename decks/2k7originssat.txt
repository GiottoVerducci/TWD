Deck Name: Angellore

This is yet another breed boon deck from me, inspired by a similar deck by
Wes Weston. You've got Bastille Opera House and Conductor to pass Con
Boons and KRCs. Note that Conductor is still effective while the vampire
is in torpor. Siren's Lure with Majesty and Soak to get actions to succeed
wound up being very effective. It's a pain in the neck that Siren's Lure
is rare, but it's an outstanding card that really does get the job done.
The Entrancements were money for me, and the DIs were lifesavers. It can
be a bit nerve-wracking playing without bounce, not to mention the looming
threat of Anarchist Uprising, but you're not spending a lot of pool on
minions, and you're gaining a lot from the Con Boons.
