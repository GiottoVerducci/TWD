-- 1GW7 + 3VP in final

"Lone Biker and his Pup"
Concept: Bruise

Couple notes,
-Julius wants to prove himself to Wynn by defending the Pack and
diablerizing
-Combat is based on enviromental damage, so allies and Memories of
Mortality won't be too big of a problem (also helps with dodgy and
maneuvering opponents)
-Shadow of the Beast was replaced with Hawg since equipping with Hawg
provides +1 stealth and I don't need maneuvers in combat (Claws of the
Dead can give maneuver in dire help)
-Pentex is for contest and ...well it's also a good card anyways
