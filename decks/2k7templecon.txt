Deck Name: Unacceptable Boon

Description: Yet another in my line of breed-boon decks. This one
was born from a conversation with Brian Moritz at the 2006 NAC, where
he mentioned using Unacceptable Appearance on your own !Nos. Legacy
of Pander is the clear use of this, so I adapted my breed-boon
template to !Nos-Pander. Greensleeves and Lukas (whose appearances on
their cards are already unacceptable) get UA, then make Creation Rites
babies. You eventually play Legacy of Pander for killer vote lock,
and call Consanguineous Boons and KRCs. I didn't notice until after
the fact that Lukas has inferior Serpentis, so throw in a couple
Temptations or a Form of Corruption for added fun. Thanks to Matt
Hirsch for running the event, and thanks to Grant, Ximon, and the
staff of TempleCon for having us!
