Deck Name: Pale Panda Warriors

In theory, this fat Pander deck taps people with various
special abilities and Majesty's and supposedly does pool
damage. In practice, bounce is pretty good, especially
with evasion bleed as predator (prelim round), and hanging
around accidentally results in VPs (finals).

"This deck looks tame out of the gate and seemed to have
it's trouble aganst my AUS intercept deck. But I stood
corrected as I faced this menace in the final only to fall
helplessly as his predator to the floor. I was amazing at
the glorious victory he pulled out in the final seconds of
the match to crush the Lasombra." - Mike Courtois
