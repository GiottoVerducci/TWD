Deck Name: Jacked Up

Description: Samedi Anarch Wall. Centered around Jack Dawson and his
amazing weapon skills, make sure you go Anarch the hardway as soon as
you can and share the Camera Phone for bleed via Forced March or Hag's
Wrinkle. The Rumor Mill should've been a WMRH but I forgot to swap it
out before the tournament so thems the breaks.
