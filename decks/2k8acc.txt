-- 3VP in final

Deck: Assamite Bleed / Vote
Description: Uses the Alamut as the key card vote defense and
occasional vote calling, mainlys bleeds and bloats with Haqims LAw:
Leadership. Based on a deck I saw at the Welsh ECQ a couple of years
ago, by Oortji I think, updated with the mighty new cards.
