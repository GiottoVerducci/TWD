Deck Name: Circle of Madness

Description: Use Lutz and other IC to gain vote superiority, but don't
call politics to aggressively or you will get bashed, rather use
Lutz's text to damage your prey's pool and to keep him from helping
others vote if he has any votes and also if you're encountering wall
just let someone else's politics do your job.
Try to go combo bleed+true love's face+crock tongue+change of target
for max damage on your prey's minions.
Just play out slow and give everyone a chance to reduce their pool to
reasonable amounts before you start an offensive. Also calling
politics in predator's turn with Enkil Cog is nice:)
