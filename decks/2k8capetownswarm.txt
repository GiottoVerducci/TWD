Deck Name: Saulot the Puppeteer

Description: The deck is fairly straight-forward. Take over your
prey's minions to bleed themselves out. Keep Saulot and your pool
going with Renewed Vigors. On hindsight, the Heidelberg's were more
useful than the use they were intended for (transferring blood from
Renewed Vigors).
