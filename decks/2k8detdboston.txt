Deck Name: Lasombra Mamba 2008

This is a variant of the Lasombra obt/dom stealth/bleed deck that I've
been playing for years. The primary function is stealth/bleed, but it
has a few non-stealth options like Anarch Troublemakers and
Seduction. The biggest change I made for this particular variant was
going for group 3/4 instead of group 2/3. The g3/4 crypt is
definitely weaker on votes but has a somewhat better selection of obt/
dom mid-caps.

a toolboxy throw-in

good for shattering hearts and sport bikes

Primarily used to avoid AI, or to scope out wakes or bounce.

Really not worth a blood or a card slot.

Obviously could use some On the Qui Vive
