Victor Kemp

Deck Name: Victor's Deck of Dominate

This was our national constructed tournament event held at Upcon 2008.
There was a good attendence at this tournament and the metagame was
dominated by bruise-bleed decks. The final table was swept up by Victor,
after some cunning tabletalk and strategic deal-breaking.

The final table looked like this:
Victor playing Sneak/Bleed Protean Dominate bleeding
Jacque playing Kiasyd Sneak/Bleed toolbox bleeding
Michael playing Tupdog and Friends rush deck bleeding
Jesse playing Setite are tempting and enticing deck bleeding
Alex Pardo playing Shambling Hordes deck

Description: Straight forward sneak and bleed deck with Dominate
and Protean. The general lack of intercept at the tournament certainly
helped this deck work, as well as Stanislava's repeat performances.
