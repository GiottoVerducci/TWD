-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: The wall that is not really a wall

This deck originally started as mono Auspex deck with guns and Black
Hand-tech for bloating purposes, but evolved into something that can
actually oust players as well. The gameplan is to feign being a bleed
deck that's not drawing into its payload while bloating enough to bring
out a few minions and equip one or two Magnums. Once you feel you're
pretty safe from your predator, start actively blocking your prey's
minions with Eagle's Sight and bleed hard into him. Once you have
secured a VP just bloat and block some more and be the last man
standing for the 3VP game win.

Taste of Vitae is vital to keep your bloat going and the Target Vitals
act a nasty surprise that deters combat decks from picking a fight with
you. It can also be used to knock out a weakened minion or put a rather
painful dent into a War Ghoul or some other ally. Other than that it's
really just a wall with a healthy amount of stealth bleed to go with it.
