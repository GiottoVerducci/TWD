-- 2GW10 + 2.5VP in final

Deck Name: European Brujah Potpourri

Description: Got lucky, perfect fit for the metagame that day.
Entering the final with 2GW10VP. 2.5VP in final Worked fine
and had a great flow, just enough combat to keep peolpe guessing. Can
surely be improved. Of course, New Carthage needs to be put in.
