-- 4VP in final

Deck Name: Sheldon & Co 2008

Description: Standard Ugly Princes. Was preyed on by
Jon Glas' Marcus Vitel & Hunters in 3 of the 4 rounds.
I back ousted him in the 1st round, then was one of
the victims of a sweep by them in the 2nd.

Is only able to stand up to Hunter Nega-Cept if both
bounces, both DI's, and 7 of 8 2nd Trads are drawn in
the 1st 40 cards. If you'd like to draw a Bowl Of
Convergence, then there should be more than one in your deck.
