Deck Name: Amavarati et ses amis

Description: My take on what is becoming a classic breed-bleed/vote
archetype. Inspired largely by the latest TWDA version of Inaki
Jimenez but adapted to my taste of playing lots of masters plus the
inclusion of some staple cards designed to survive the harsh qualifier
environment and a reduced capacity crypt.
