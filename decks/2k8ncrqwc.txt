-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Weepy Bleed V4

Description: Fairly straightforward, archetypical weenie [pre] bleed
with 4-cylinder crypt engine.

Not as defensive as tap-n-bleed Mind Numb [PRE] versions, but
significantly faster to the oust.

Jost is a questionable investment, but +1 stealth has won enough games to merit continued inclusion.

Propaganda is hit or miss. It has won enough games to still occupy a couple of slots among the 48 bleed actions.
// Public Trust is pure gold here, frequently financing a 1-cap vampire early in the game.

From a Sinking Ship seems to get used in about half of the games played.
// Momentum's Edge is a bit questionable, but a few extra pool never hurts in the late game.
// Previous versions have toyed with Direct Intervention, which would still be a fine inclusion.
