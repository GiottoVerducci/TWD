Hugh Angseesing

-- 4VP in final

Deck Name: Americano Mafiaoso
Created by: Hugh Angseesing & Ze Germans

Description: Generally pretty strong - doesn't like too much
combat (lost 5 Nephandus in one game to theft
and guns combo). Simple plan, get out Antonio
and one of his support and build up for a bit
then start moving forward. Ankara Citadel is very
strong especially when Narrow Minds hits the table.
