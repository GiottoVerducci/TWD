-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Dualism in America
Created by: Hugh Angseesing & Marko Lindroos

Description: Very flexible deck based upon Marko's Dualism deck.
Main changes are reducing the dual forms by three
as I was seeing far too much combat in the previous
week's games. 2x Powerbase Barranquilla were also
replaced for Chicago and a blood doll as I much prefer
Chicago. Meant to change the crypt for more Malabranca's
but never got around to it. Would then drop the Guarded
Rubrics, as I never seem to draw it when I have Ondine anyway.
