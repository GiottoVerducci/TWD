Deck Name: Gangrel Wall

Description: This is the second tournament win with the deck. Should
include 2-3 vessels but everything else seems to work really well. The
only real problem comes if the prey is straight forward as he can go
with 3VP befor you can even try to stop him. I stole the final from
my malk B&S prey with his own major boon thanks to the fragment
playing it on my predator to keep him alive just enough time for the
GW
