Deck Name: Lasombra capitalists

Description: Trying to bleed without spending all the blood from
my vampires. It is good to be blocked every now and then so you
are not seen as a table threat.

/* I made this deck in 30 minutes and there are some second best
solutions just because of my unfortunate but self-inflicted time
constraint

Bottom heavy line of capacities. I'm quite happy with my
choices here

Could do without all the Lasombra-masters

I was suprised to not be able to actually use the
Graverobbing. I was expecting much more violent behavior.

Free dodge with additional strike is so strong. Actually I was
planning to get blocked every once in a while and thats why I
have more combat cards than stealth.

These were supposed to be cannon fodder but I dealt
differently with rush decks (in round 1 I gave Beast one hour to
go forward and get an oust before trying to oust its
controller. A deal that was worth it for both of us I think). But
they actually served as offence and in the final table Nocturns
finished both of my ousts in a single turn.

Card flow was decent and I was quite happy with the balance
between modifiers and combat cards. The deck in itself isn't very
clever or anything, but 38 dominate cards seems to get the work
done. */
