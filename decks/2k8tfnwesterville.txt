Deck Name: Tembo!!

Description: Demdemeh makes a herd of elephant allies with 2 hand
damage and one bleed. Babalawo Alafin combines with Maabara to allow
you to craft the hand you need.

It didn't work the way it was intended to in the finals. In retrospect
I should have brought out Demdemeh instead of Wamukota as my second
vampire, but I thought his ability would be important for my retain
actions(it was never used). I never could get enough pool to bring
out Demdemeh afterwards. A herd of elephants would have greatly
increased my ousting ability.

It is nice to know that the deck can survive without all of the "A"
team in play.
