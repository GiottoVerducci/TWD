Deck Name: Two-Fisted Hand Tools

As I write this up I notice I have 88 cards instead of 90, and since I
was decked 2 of my 3 games I should probably address this! Blood
management can be an issue and getting off a well-timed Festivo 2 of
the 3 games was key. Mind Rape was less useful than I
anticipated...probably better off with Scouting Missions to increase
my crypt-machine mechanism early in the game. Deep Cover Agent is
handy when I remember to actually use it! Card flow is handled with
Heart and the 3 Dreams, but there were a couple of times I had to play
through some ugly clumping. A few more permanents are probably in
order, particularly Guarded Rubrics and a weapon or two.
