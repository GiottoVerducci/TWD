Hugh Angseesing

-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Canadian Mafiaoso
Created by: Hugh Angseesing & Ze Germans

Description: Generally pretty strong - doesn't like too much
combat (lost 3 Nephandus in the final to crows).
For some reason a DT has replaced a wash from the version used at
Origins. I have no idea why - I probably misplaced it somewhere.....
