Deck: I love the Tremere
This deck is all about being flexible and tooling up with whatever the
game situation dictates. Constant pressure forward and bring out the
hordes of Tremere to overwhelm. Seems to work pretty well most of the
time, could maybe do with another Muaziz for her extra stealth for
forward motion but her disciplines aren't great.

Deck based on concepts I saw from Barnaby Dromgool and refined using
Steve Harris' deck from last years LCQ in Melbourne.
