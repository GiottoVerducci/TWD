Deck Name: Jacob's Pack

Description: Radoslaw Staszewski's recent deck from the news group.
Little tweaks here and there, especially taking more out of Jacob's
special. I never used Frontal Assault but it has potential. Loki's
Gifts fit nicely here as you'll be hunting after Tribute. The deck can
bleed pretty well but Fame and Dragonbound were essential lunge cards.
Dark Influences could be replaced by a couple of Direct Interventions
to cancel Entrancements and such. Two Garous and Ossian were stolen
from me during the finals...
