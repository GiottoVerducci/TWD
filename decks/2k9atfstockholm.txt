Deck Name: Who needs Deep Song?

Comment: I really enjoy playing this type of straightforward deck.
While others play complicated decks, whine alot and try to make weird
deals to win, this just ousts it's prey. I took Tuomas Nybergs "Dr
Julius dental care" deck and switched potence for animalism (Gate for
Aid, Increased for Crows). I can only wonder how good the deck should
have been if I actually owned 14 Deep Song.
