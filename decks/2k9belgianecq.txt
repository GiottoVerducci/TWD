-- 4VP in final

Deck Name: Cogwork Brussels

Description: The deck is a Nosferatu multi-action toolbox with an
emphasis on bleeding. The foundation of the deck is Cock Robin's
special ability to untap after a successful action requiring
Animalism. Also Baron Dieudonne can untap after a successful action
(but only by paying a blood). Another untap possibility is provided by
Warsaw Station. With Tier of Souls, Deep Song and eventually Enkil Cog
the deck has considerable bleed potential. Thanks to Preternatural
Strength you only need to make room for few extra combat cards to be
very effective in combat, while being able to do "defensive rushing"
with Deep Song.
Maybe the deck's biggest advantage in a tournament is that other
players tend to underestimate its bleed potential and in general have
trouble assessing the deck's capabilities.
