Deck Name: Rake's & Folker's Immortal Disarming SHOW !

Description: This deck has been created around the Brujah Debate
card and designed to capitalize to the maximum the power of the
NEW CARTHAGE!!! Really a super-power card, especially in this
deck with lots of titled vampires of low capacity! Not so simply
to play but strong enough to resist in almost all situations!
