Deck Name: mINIMAL sTYLE

1GW3.5 (5th seed) + 4VP in final

Description: I wanted to build this deck the moment
I've seen Nana Buruku on the white-wolf website
(before the release). Since I didn't have the time
and energy to trade for or the money to buy 15 deep
songs, 9 ashurs and 4 target vitals it took me until
now to get all the cards together (big thanks to
Gyula Erd√µs who borrowed me 11 deep songs, 3 ashurs
and 3 vitals). After playing some friendly games and
this tournament I will replace two cards for another
cats guidance and on the qui vive. Otherwise I am
happy with all my choices.

I made it to the finals with 1GW3.5VP-s as the fifth
finalist. The seating in the finals was actually really
cool for me. With some luck I made 1GW4VP in final
