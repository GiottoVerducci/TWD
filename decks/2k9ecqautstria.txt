-- 1GW3.5 (5th seed) + 4vp in final

Deck Name: mINIMAL sTYLE

Description: I wanted to build this deck the moment
I've seen Nana Buruku on the white-wolf website
(before the release). Since I didn't have the time
and energy to trade for or the money to buy 15 deep
songs, 9 Ashurs and 4 Target Vitals it took me until
now to get all the cards together (big thanks to
Gyula Erdõs who borrowed me 11 Deep Songs, 3 Ashurs
and 3 Vitals). After playing some friendly games and
this tournament I will replace two cards for another
cats guidance and on the qui vive. Otherwise I am
happy with all my choices.

I made it to the finals with 1GW3.5 as the fifth
finalist. The seating in the finals was actually really
cool for me. With some luck I made 4vp in final
