Deck Name: Neo-Lawfirm

Description: There are now 3 different lawfirm crypts and this one is
probably the weakest of the three. Something that makes people
underestimate the vampires you bring into play from time to time. The
deck is very versatile and features plenty of silver bullets which
helps you handle most situations you encounter.
