-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Humanoids From the Deep

Humo or Gemini crank out Nocturns and Underbridge Strays. Hannah
Montana and "We Like the Moon" Guedado get War Ghouls. Use Agent of
Power to bump up disciplines (especially for getting superior Strays)
or to give a Tzimisce Obtenebration for fast Nocturn + War Ghoul
action. Remember to use the presses from the Strays to help your War
Ghouls (I often used them to bail out of ANI combat). Deploy Corrupt
Construction for lockdown.
