-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Enkidu the Great

Description: Enter combat / block - torporize - burn with Nephandus.
Mages were magnificent in game 3 where they blocked several bum's
rushes / bleeds when I didn't have enough manouvers in my hand to
fight with Anson Cel/Gun deck. In the late game it is great to
have additional bleeders with 4 life and no minion in front of you:)
That deck would probably never survive a malk bleed deck.
That was supposed to be a fun deck but after several changes I would
find some potential there.
