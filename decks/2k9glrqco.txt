-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: Traditional Princess

Description: I re-tooled my Carna deck after KoT came out.
Eyes of Argus is _SO_ efficient for this scheme that I was
able to slide in a touch more combat (Rego Mortus). I also
went to 4 Smiling Jacks. A first turn Jack means I don't have
to worry about a time out at the table. Ponticulus is also very cool.
