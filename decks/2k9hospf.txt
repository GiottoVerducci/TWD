Deck Name: Aim and Chain

Description: An easy to play bruise'n'bleed deck. Get out the 5-caps,
Govern down on the small ones, you should quickly have 5 vamps out
with dom and for and plenty (about 20) pools left. Bleed steadily,
even for 1, and use the magic of the Target Vitals to maim the
blockers.
It resists quite well (surprisingly, but that's the magic of TV)
against real fight decks.
It entered the final at the third place and made GW4 during the final
between a palla embrace deck (predator) and a !Malk BS (prey).
There is an alternate crypt in group 4-5 but it uses higher caps and
is therefore too slow.
