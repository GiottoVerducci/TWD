Deck Name: No secrets 2009

1st place with 1GW6.5, 3VP in final

Description: The classic Akunanse/Magaji

Last table: Ventrue 4-5 Votes; Toreador Grand Ball 1-2; Tremere 3-4
Control rusher; Akunanse; Ventrue 4-5 weenie votes/bleeder.

When Tremere puts in play Mistress Fanchion and the Akunanse puts in
play Nkule and Ugadja, nobody can play votes without "bribes" (no the card).
Akunanse plays No secrets, and the game was over for the Tremere and the
Ventrue winnie. Ventrue 4-5 played his 2 Daring with the dawn, and after
this, cannot pass any votes. With Conditioning can pass Toreador Grand Ball,
and without opportunities, said "Ousted".

Akunanse's deck never lose a table.
