Deck Name: The Baobhan-sith, Kyasid bleed deck

Description: The idea behind this deck is of course primarily stealth
bleed, with a secondary function of trying to choose one's battles.
Chanjelin Ward and Redcap Wilder pose undesirable consequences to other
Methuselah's vampires, while Shadow Twin and Riddle Phantastique
effectively single out targets and attempt to make them weaker. With
the powerful combat supplied by Mytherceria and Obtenebration, these
vampires can usually choose whether they want to strike hard or make a
quick getaway. Archon Investigations were added to dissuade others
from trying big bleeds, and Centralized Background Checks to make the
dreaded Poker a little more expensive to get out. The strongest
vampire in this deck is, arguably, Marconius since he is the only one
to possess all three disciplines at superior as well as paying 1 less
blood for Mytherceria cards, but this deck really does not focus on
any one vampire in particular. Rather it focuses on getting as many
vampires out as possible, starting out rather slowly to create a wall
of Faerie mischief late in the game.
