Deck Name: Holiday Malkavians

I just arrived from my holiday and put this up fast. On our quite
heavy combat environment basic dementation bleed deck usually gets
devastated and that is why there is some combat in deck. Another thing
is that the vampires are just too big to be sacrificed on a spot.
After the first tournament played with this I can say that there isn't
enough stealth to go through good old fashioned wall deck. But there
is some bounces to wait for a moment to come. Also stopping some key
actions here and there proved to be valuable asset. Maybe couple of
block fails would do good. There certainly is room for improvement.
