Deck Name: Dani's Deck - Tremere/Tremere Anti Voter

I'm not sure which of the Newquists built the deck. (John or Danielle)
I just put together what I thought was in it and my own pet cards.
Thanks Newquists!! I remembered, too late, theirs had a Giant's Blood in it.
Papillon is...good. No win without it.
