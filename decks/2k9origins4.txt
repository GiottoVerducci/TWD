Deck Name: It's Pronounced "HUG-huh"
Created by: Matthew Morgan

This was the only deck I could really put together for Ebony Kingdom
as I didn't have very many EK cards yet. It was meant to have 4
Quicken Sight, but I guess I accidentally put in an extra. 5 is too
many. The 5th should be Enhanced Senses or something. Also, some of
the cards in the deck (like Familial Bond) are junk, but I wanted to
try everything new. It was originally intended to have Aye, but they
didn't make the cut.

I played this untested in the US Championship and had a very
Goldilocks experience. The first table was too stealthy and I jammed
on combat. The second one was too fighty and I couldn't keep out of
torpor. The third table was just right and I won easily. Hugh
borrowed the deck for the Sunday tournament and made the final where
he won basically by being in the best shape after the table collapsed
(a fine way to win).

His only comment to me was the deck could use a couple of Camera
Phones. Probably a good plan.

Powerbase: Luanda is quite good. It's maybe the only thing here that
makes this deck something other than a poor Toreador gun deck without
the bleed potential.
