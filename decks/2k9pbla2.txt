Deck Name: Lutz All Out

Description: Lutz is a very good vampire. Vote with Lutz, or bleed for
3 with your IC's. A sprinkling of combat and bounce. Suffers vs
dedicated combat or walls. Should probably include a DI just for things
like No Secrets. The Force of Personalities are mostly for allies,
although doubles as more SCE. I only use the Aire with a non-IC, I'm
very Archon Investigation averse... Ashurs are gold, and definitely won
me the final, and probably helped me win at least one other game.
