Deck Name: Law and Order

Description: New group Ventrue featuring Mary Anne Blaire and her
associates. Basic idea is to keep to yourself while using Mary Anne
Blaire's built in Scouting Mission to bloat, occasionally flick
bleeds, call votes, and unexpectedly unload a barrage of actions for
your oust when your prey doesn't expect it.
