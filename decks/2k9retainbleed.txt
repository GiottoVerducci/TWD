Deck Name: Bitter and Sweet !Ventrue

This deck was conceived during my absence last September. I didn't
have had the time to assemble it or test it, but when i saw that
Vicent Ripoll won the EC 2009 Day 1 tournament, i decided to give it
a try. You might consider this deck as a mix between Vicent Ripoll EC
TWD and Ruben Feldman's "Vignes" deck. I decided to play with auspex
to explore Aura Reading. It was a surprise to all players and a
good advantage to me, because i was able to look at their hands and
bled irresponsibly. Future improvements, remove "Recruiting Party",
change fortitude prevention.
