Desk: Beasts on the plains, twirling their canes
Description: This desk is inspired by Hugh Angseesing's
deck (and others) of similar name. I wanted to see if I
could make the Fortitude combat + WWS work for Akunanse.
Since the bleed offense is obviously weaker without dom,
and because I wanted to use Freak Drive and have 2 useful
actions for each minion, I added votes, which worked
pretty well. No Secrets is strong, but I was afraid of
Pentex, so I wanted to play a deck that had a reasonable
chance of getting out 2 Magaji. Also, using the Matt
Morgan school of thought, I wanted to have some good
non-threatening building actions early-game, while my prey
weakens my grand-prey. Wise Spider and Owl Companion are
great for that. This deck has limited untaps, but
canceling bounces with Terra Incognita requires only one
untapped minion, which was pretty easy given Wise Spider
or influencing out a new minion.
