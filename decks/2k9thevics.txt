-- 3VP in final

Deck Name: The Beautiful People

Description: Very reslient deck, but not really capable of fast ousts.
Need to do something to speed it up. Giant's Blood was gold all day.
Obediences were gold. Sniper Rifles were useless in ANI heavy meta.
Ashur Tablets weren't great either - if I got them up early, I didn't
really need to recur anything, and if I got them late, the game was
already over. Would be better off replacing them with some funk
(Millicent, From a Sinking Ship, etc).

Anthelios + 3MPA's = Joyyyyyyy
