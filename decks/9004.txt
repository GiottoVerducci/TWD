Description:
This is the very focused bleeddeck with a few very simple principles.
1 Hand management: have minimum amout of cards that can clog, and cards that increase card options. low amount of masters also helps.
2 Blood management: other masters are to keep the machine rolling.
3 Bleed management: Well Duh! all the other cards are for bleeding
