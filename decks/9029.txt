Deck Name: Twelve Little Legionnaires aka And Then There Were None
Description:  Ideally, you'd want to start with Erlik, use his special to pump down 5 blood to add Erebus and some other fellow necromancers to the team asap. If possible, get your legionnaires into play by means of regular recruit actions. Use their special ability as a secondary option only. Try to play your turns quickly, as you'll have a lot of stuff to do and need some time to gain the proper momentum.
