Deck Name: Dreams of Revelations
Description: A deck I made last minute on the spot, because I didn't know what to play on sunday and wanted to try Nefertiti Adv. :)
In my mind it was a better Nakhthorheb: maybe less "in your face" powerful, but better able to react, more polyvalent. This version is far from optimal. I wanted to make fun use of corruption but I really got only one minion like that (and it was useless), and when I didn't get Sarrasine I needed to use an action and a blood with Nefertiti to make good use of Revelation of Desire. Don't think it's worth it all things considered. But maybe it's because it was suboptimal that people let me win, so who's complaining? ;-)
