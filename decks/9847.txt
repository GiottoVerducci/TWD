Library (65 cards)
Master (20)
2x Anarch Railroad
1x Anarch Troublemaker -- really there to destroy guns.
2x Creepshow Casino
1x Direct Intervention
1x Garibaldi-Meucci Museum -- it's weird that I think I could remove this and not mind...but the minute that I do I'll want it to recur Pipers.
2x Jake Washington
5x Liquidation -- key pool gain function and more wraiths.
1x Pentex(TM) Subversion -- still good, basically won the final.
3x Piper
1x Powerbase: Cape Verde -- good overall, great if you have Jake in play.
1x Powerbase: Los Angeles -- unlocking [dom] minions is good

Action (9)
4x Embrace, The -- even better now that sect inheritance is a thing
5x Sudario Refraction -- because (repeat after me) recursion is broken.

Ally (13)
1x Carlton Van Wyk -- happy to use him, or contest him.
8x Cry Wolf -- buys time and makes Diary counters. I do miss having a standing press source but was never that happy with how Mob Connections performed in previous versions.
1x Gianna di Canneto -- fantastic special gave me the 7th counter in the final. She could be doubled up and the deck would not suffer.
1x Ossian -- after all, I have Target Vitals so a fat Ossian is pretty common.
1x Tye Cooper -- another layer of recursion that I usually end up discarding unless there's a rush combat deck near me.
1x Vivienne GÃ©roux -- mostly just extra bleed, but I've pushed her onto vote decks on rare occasions. Hilarity ensued.

Equipment (1)
1x Heart of Nizchetus -- I've got enough actions that this tends to get great leverage.

Action Modifier (3)
3x Call of the Hungry Dead

Reaction (11)
4x Deflection -- and this is why
2x Delaying Tactics
5x On the Qui Vive -- preferred wake effect for disposable ally decks.

Combat (5)
5x Target Vitals -- I'm playing these more in the second round of wolf combat, now that I've cut to 5 copies.

Event (3)
1x FBI Special Affairs Division
2x Unmasking, The -- greatly increases win ratios
