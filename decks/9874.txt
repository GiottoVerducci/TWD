Created by: Tim
Description: The deck is a very solid defensive deck which abuses 2 of the most strong defensive cards in VtES : second tradition and Earth Meld. The ousting power is based on a strong combo of permanent : Homunculus, +1 Bleed on Rachel and Madness Network. For the full package there is also perfectionist and Enkil Cog for the possibility to bleed for 3 during the turn of every player without cards nor cost. Actually having only part of the full combo can already be strong and Madness Network should not be defended at all cost Enkil Cog being already very strong.
The specificity of my version of the deck is the fact that it abuses Rachel card text with 62 cards total, the Heart of cheating and Fragment+Barrens to kind of always have the perfect hand. I regularly have the 3 in play and after that I can change 3 cards in my hand beginning my turn (and keep the master and permanents I want to play) and I can change up to 4 cards at the end of the turn reshuffling what I will need for the rest of the game without depleting my library. The 2 directs are very strong for a deck that is active during the turn of the other players and allows alongside the 4 maneuvers to keep IG players at bay.
