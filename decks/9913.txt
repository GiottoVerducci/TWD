-- 2GW8 + 4vp in final

A quick overview

17 players assembled to fight in the first Belgian event since the start of the pandemic, quite a respectable turnout given the circumstances! The overall metagame seemed to favour focused/aggressive decks, with somewhat fewer walls and combat than is common at these latitudes. After three hard-fought rounds, StÃ©phane D thought he could not be in the finals with 1GW3 and left before all games finished... thus relinquishing his finalist spot to Bart.

The final's seating was as follows:
Rahma (Spell of Life) -> Nicolas (Kyasiphandus) -> Vincent (Shattering Crescendo) -> Bart (Lutz) -> Emiliano (new royalty).

The final was a quick affair, over in about 1 hour. Emiliano started strong voting against Rahma, reducing the time available for the Spells of Life to fire, while Nicolas bled Vincent constantly, forcing the latter to look mostly backwards. Bart was a bit unlucky with Zillahs and took some time to bring out Lutz. Then there was a "sliding doors" turn where all parallel universes seemed to collide: Rahma's well-played Delaying Tactics left Emiliano at three pool and open to Bart, then Rahma also Suddened Nicolas' third Ashur, ruining his chances to oust Vincent. In turn, Vincent found no block or bounce on his way to oust Bart with two Legal Manipulations. This allowed Emiliano to oust Rahma and prepare the endgame via his own third Ashur. Finally, after an Ancilla Empowerment+Neonate Breach combo ousted Nicolas and left Vincent at 3 pool, it did not take long for the struggle to conclude.

Result: Emiliano 4vp, Vincent 1vp

A big big thank you to all participants for a very fun day of bleeding (and politicking) and... thanks also for letting me win, for once!

Deck Name: Infernal Princes of Anarchy
Played by: Emiliano Imeroni
Description:
All credit to the deck's creator, grandmaster Bram Van Stappen! Thank you!
A new generation of the classic "Royalty" deck based on the new cheap Fifth Edition Princes, with the "Reckless" support of Anarch Barons and of the invaluable Lutz-cancelling star Arishat.
Instructions for use: steal deck from Bram the day before the event, then quickly unleash your political might on everyone while trying to stay (barely) alive.
