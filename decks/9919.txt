-- 2GW6 + 1.5 in final

Now that the vaccinations have been available for a while and most people have got their second shots, we felt like its a perfect time to get some live Vampire tournaments going!
Good amount of players showed up. Games were pretty fast and aggressive overall, with a lot of bleeds and votes and almost no combat.

Finals Seating:
Mari Tiippana (Presence & Obfuscate) --> Aapo Järvelin (Malgorzata + Lernean) --> Lauri Salmi (Giotto Mute + Vote) --> Lasse Pöyry (Aabbt Kindred Hatch the Viper) --> Teemu Pulkkinen (Black Hand Swarm Bleed)

Deck Name: Lernean shoots you twice
Description:
Yeah, there is no Heart of Nizchetus, I don't feel like I need it. Never missed it once during the tournament. I'd rather get something that actually impacts the game and doesn't make me lose time. There is no need to force anything to happen.
