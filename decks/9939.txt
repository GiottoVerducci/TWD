-- 2GW7 + 4vp in final

Deck Name: Enkidu CEL/PRO
Description: A deck I hadn't played in a while, with some changes I didn't even remember compared to the version I used to win the French NC in 2012 http://www.vekn.fr/decks/twd.htm#2012fncrf
The deck was originally a multi-rush, but since I reduced the number of alternate rushes, I never managed to perform two rushes in the same turn during the tournament.
I made a few mistakes in the first round that cost me the GW, but the 4-players format (16 players only) greatly helped making GW in the other rounds.
The final round was fairly easy to win once my predator and grand-predator had annihilated each other.

Final seating:
> 1 Serge Cirri (FoS BS with Nefertiti merged)
> 2 Christophe Verdier (Weenie Samedi equip / rush)
> 3 Vincent Ripoll (Enkidu)
> 4 Axel Huet (fat FoS Bleed with Nakhthorheb)
> 5 Antonin MÃ©rieux (Samedi Wall with Troglodytia)
