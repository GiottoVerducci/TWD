Deck Name: Big Toreador Deck

Here is the winning deck for "Ascendance: 1", with comments from the winner.
It's a very interesting combination deck using Pool Gain, Votes, Intercept,
and Bounce:

By: Brian Wellington

"I usually call this the 'big Toreador deck'. It's based around large Toreadors
with useful special abilities. Most of them have votes, and most have +bleed.
The deck mostly tries to gain pool (5th Tradition, Voter Cap, Minion Tap, Blood
Doll, etc). There are votes to call, and the natural bleeds. There's enough
intercept to block a non-stealth bleed deck, and a bit of bleed bounce.
There are a lot of untaps - Wake, 2nd Tradition, and Alexandra and Masika's
abilities. Combat defense is based around presence S:CE, celerity dodge and
prevent, and the Elysium.

"The deck mostly worked as planned in the tournament, with a few surprises.
I torpored 6 vampires in the final round with Catatonic Fear and celerity
cards, which has never happened before. Very few votes succeeded (I never
used a Voter Cap), but bleeding worked fairly well. I also never saw a duplicate
vampire in a game, which is often a problem with this crypt, and it also helped
that I didn't see any other Toreador decks."
