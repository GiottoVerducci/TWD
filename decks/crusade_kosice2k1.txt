Crusade: Kosice
Kosice, Slovakia

Karol Magda

Deck Name: Omaya

Description: Your aim is to get last 3VP on the table , agitate the
table to slow things down so you can build up your force , bring out
at least four minions and try to avoid pool loss. Be nice to your
predator and only block him , do not kill his vampires unless it's
necessary, doing so you can avoid his last spite when he will be dying.
Don't let your prey gain pool if it is possible and bleed for a lot.
Use eagle's sights only as an emergency intercept, otherwise
reserve it for cross table threats (or ousting bleed of your prey).
