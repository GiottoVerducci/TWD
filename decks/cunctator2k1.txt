I had seen on Lasombra's tournament winning decks page Johnny Tullner's
deck that won Fleecing the Gaje, held in Washington, D.C. I really like his
use of four Anarch Troublemaker. In Johnny's comments on the deck he wrote
"* Using an Anarch Troublemaker and then playing one is an excellent
tactic." Yes Johnny, it is. I decided to try to make room for my four
A.T.s. I was only able to fit three in, and in doing so I ended up with too
many master cards in the deck. Well, I wouldn't be writing this if I
didn't win, so I guess it couldn't have been that bad.

Frederick is NOT Weak!
