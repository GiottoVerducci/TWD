This is *my* Toolbox
by Ethan Burrow

The idea was to vote/bloat with Voter Captivations acting as 5th Traditions,
since the Sabbat can't obviously play 5th Tradition. Most other cards in the
deck were either single shot utilitarian or very versatile in keeping with my
current trend of toolboxing. You may note that a lot of the cards have
multiple uses.

Enchant Kindred can serve 3 purposes; speed up influencing, bleed, or pool
gain. All the intercept cards doubled as bleed bounce, so I could defend
against many deck types.

I also wanted to include enough combat defense that I might be able to survive
a rush deck long enough to grab 1VP.

The fact that there are only 12 masters was purely coincidental, and had
nothing to do with Atlanta &lt;g&gt;.
