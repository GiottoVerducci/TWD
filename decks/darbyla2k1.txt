Deck Name: WeePee Bleed 101

Description & Playstyle: Concept and play are simple, BLEEEEED!

Process: Try to influence 3-4 vampires out in the
same turn, unless you're being no-stealth bleed for
a bunch early. Pentex that big vampire your prey
first influences after you've got your critters in a
line. Attempt to bleed with enhancement. Use S:CE to
tap out any Wakey blockers. Repeat process lots of times,
using Propaganda & Anarch Troublemaker only when you think
you can bleed your prey out.

Hint: If you don't have S:CE in hand, consider bleeding
anyway. Use Media Influence (sup) to refill anyone in torpor
(it works on all controlled vampires), then rescue them and
begin bleeding again. If you have too much S:CE, bleed anyway
and hope for combat to clear your hand.

Pool management is mostly from rapid ousting and can
cause high stomach acid levels. Social Charm (sup), Enchant
Kindred (sup) and Tribute to the Master followed by Media
Influence (sup) can supplement when Tums(r) are insufficient.
Deck is weakest against vote, steath bleed and weenie bleed decks.

Possible offensive improvements/variants, depending
on metagame:
Pump bleed by using 4-8 Legal Manipulation replacing
Social Charm and/or Tribute to the Master.
Get slightly more deceitful - and nominally faster,
by adding 1-4 more Aire of Elation, in place of Enchant Kindred.
Add more tap effects with 1-2 Propaganda in place of Enchant Kindred or

Possible defensive improvements/variants, depending on metagame:
Substitute 1-2 Archon Investigation for Tribute to the Master.
Consider 1-4 Delaying Tactics in place of Social Charm and/or Enchant Kindred.
