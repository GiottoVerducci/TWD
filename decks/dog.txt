Deck Name: Extreme Sports

The Winning Deck:
Description: Tremere push the pain for all it's worth...

Instructions:
1: If the tourney rules allow you, don't be afraid to strip this deck by as
many as 30 cards...
a) The gangrel de-evolutions are because gangrel's persistent small bleeds
and many combat-ends cards are annoying.
b) The strained vitae supplies are great against pleb-decks.
c) Strip one Chainsaw and all Vast Wealth if you think the chainsaw is in
danger from canine hordes. If you think it may get stolen with fast
hands... Keep it in! ;o)

2: Try to save the bursts of sunlight for when you're blocking. Or your
opponent will just dodge of Combat ends.

3: Dawn-op, weather control, skin of night:o)

4: The chainsaw will start an entropic process, ending in your demise, or
the chainsaw-bearer going to torpor... Make sure you time its appearance so
that you have won before it causes you to lose. The restorations, the fifth
trads, the chantry, and the masochism will all help to make the chainsaw as
painless as possible.

5: The Chainsaw can be used twice in a turn if you use Heidelburg.

6: You *need* someone out with superior auspex if your predator is capable
of large bleeds.

7: You *can* survive for some time without a prince or justicar, but you'll
probably need one for the end-game.

8: Blood-dolls, restorations, fifth-trads, and the Arcane Library are your
blood-generation, Bindusara has superior auspex and can get you the arcane

Political Defense: Block them.
S&B Defense: Deflect them until you can chop 'em up.
Pleb Defense: Beat 'em up, and eat 'em. Strained vitae supply.
Combat Defense: Agg-damage (dawn op / Weather control, or block and wait for
a good chance at Burst of sunlight, then be sure to diablerise them.
