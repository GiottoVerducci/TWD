Deck Name: Dragon Con 2001 Ventrue

Description: I built this deck the morning of the tournament because
I had not seen any Ventrue decks the night before and I wanted to play
one. I think that the Ventrue are (just by a small margin) the strongest
clan in the game but I hate to contest Vampires all day so I avoid
playing them too much. The deck is pretty basic. I do not normally
use Queen Anne unless I am working the dominate angle. I also really
wanted to use Kiss of Ra and Seduction to screw with the intercept
decks. It really worked. I got to Kiss Meshenka with a Revenant and
then Seduce Dragos when I grave robbed. I also got to grave rob Ulugh
Beg and an one-armed Basil (It was a card cycle thing). I had Jan out
in two games, which I think screwed with a lot of people's minds. He
was also able to bleed for 2 most every turn due to my prey being scared
of his Kiss of Ra. The deck got 4, 2.5 and 4 (a sweep) VPs and then 2.5VP
in the Finals. I never got near the end of my library so I would cut out
15 cards (Deflect, Con Ag, Club Z, Closed Session, Bonding, B.O. WwEF,
2 x Voter Cap, SoS, Majesty, Obedience, Govern and Freak Drive) and I
would swap the Queen for a second Emerson. A valuable lesson I learned
playing in this tourney is that Emerson can tell that mad rusher, Theo
Bell, to have a seat and try again next turn. There was a Theo deck at
two of the table I played at. This deck is not that strong in offence so
I had to play careful and do a lot of table talking. The only deals I made
regarding VPs took place in the finals and I only had to follow through on
one of them. The other one was a "I will let you oust him if you then roll
over" deal but my prey was unable to complete his end of the deal so he
had to go and I had to do the oust myself.
