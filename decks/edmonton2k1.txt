Deck Name: 2k1.6.03 v0.6 (Edit)


The idea behind the deck is simple:
keep yourself alive, almost indefinitely, by bloating like crazy
from the Blood Dolls / Hungry Coyote combination, supplemented by
Govern the Unaligned and Scouting Mission at superior. After you
have a suitable number of minions up and your prey is low enough
in pool (less than twelve, heh), steamroll your prey with stealthed
+2/+1 bleeds from your four or five minions. Machiavelli sums it
up nicely: "And here we must observe that men must either be
flattered or crushed; for they will revenge themselves for slight
wrongs; whilst for grave ones they cannot. The injury, therefore,
that you do a man should be such that you need not fear for revenge."

The weak spots of this deck, as with most focused decks, are numerous.
The lack of intercept, with the exception of Angelica, is a major sore
spot, which actually cost me two victory points in the final. Should
anyone seek to replicate this deck, I suggest substituting a number
of intercept cards in for the Redirections. A heavy-duty rush-combat
deck with Immortal Grapple would tear this deck to shreds, as the
maneuvers are light. Depending on your local metagame, replacement
of a number of Shadow Step for Arms of the Abyss may be in order.
The addition of a Power Structure, to defend against vote-based decks,
would also benefit the deck greatly as it will often finish the game
with four-plus minions.
