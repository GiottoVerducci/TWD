* I spent long hours tuning this deck to mathematical perfection.
* Using an Anarch Troublemaker and then playing one is an excellent tactic.
* Hand jam is the biggest problem, but usually the only thing to discard is
locations you already have out.
* Tribute to the Master is almost never used. It's there for emergencies.
* There are 4 rares, 21 uncommons, and 56 commons. I love the balance of
Jyhad that does not rely on rarity.
* The deck will usually sweep. Expect the whole table to come after you.
* My friends don't let me play this against them, and I don't blame them.
