Deck Name: Whole Lotta Faces

Description: The deck was created rather quickly to take advantage of the
"multiple action modifiers of the same type" loophole found in Mask 1k. The
idea was to use Mask 1k to be able to play multiple Command of the Beast on the
same action. Also, Mask is easy enough to cycle if they decide not to block me
so I can cycle readily.

I think the concept is strong but the execution really isn't good at all. The
deck was never playtested and wasn't finished until a few minutes before the
event started. It is missing Master Cards and has too few Govern bleeds and a
number of other things I'd tweak. The deck also jams massively on stealth. In
the prelims I had Anarch decks at my tables and the 4 cap vampires and some
quick bleeds helped me oust my preys. In the finals, I was fortunate enough to
have the end-game come down to Jason Dawson and myself. Jason was playing a
heavy heavy auspex intercept deck. Jason's hearty block attempts at 4-6
intercept were just what my over-stealthed deck needed to cycle for the bleed
cards. It was fate.
