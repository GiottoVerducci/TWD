Deck Name: EuroBrujah 2001

It's a reworked version of the old classic, built to handle most
threats but a field of pure focus would not be the best. Other than
my various Ventrue creations and the retired LoP. deck it is probably
the one that I have spent most time over the years tweaking and analysing.
Interestingly it is also the deck that I have scored the least VP's (1)
with in a tourney with ? Metagames hey !!

It tackles most common ‘tourney standard' decks very well and slugs it
out with all but pure Gangrel Potence and Tzimisce Scorpion Sting/Blood
of Acid. Got to be wary of Kiss of Ra and Hostile Takeover, they are
really the only two things that really worry it consistently.

I did have another Sudden Reversal and 2 Leathers in up to a few minutes
before the tourney but traded them out for the Guardian Angel,
another Disarm and a 7th Second Tradition.

The Guardian Angel was amazingly useful and came out in most of the rounds,
the 7th Second was exactly the right amount on the day. Very happy with the
decks performance, it had enough whack to take out Beast and friends in a
pure combat deck and was ‘focussed' enough to apply consistent pressure on
my prey all the time.
