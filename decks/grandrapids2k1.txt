Deck Name: 'What I learned at the National Championship'...

or 'Yes I can block every action'

Play anarch revolt. Block all actions that damage anyone, you want to
make sure that the anarch's do their damage in order so everyone is
ousted in sequence. Always bring out Anneke for her built in eagle
sight, then 2nd Tradition/Obedience everyone. Also 1st Tradition so
people have to pay even more to take a turn..you don't need them just
block. Minion tap/5th Tradition for pool gain.

Deck idea came from my first round at the nationals where Bernie B.
was playing his ultra sucky "All 6 traditions" deck. The 1st
tradition he played combined with someone elses anarch revolt killed
everyone on the table. Usually makes for a fast game, you kill or die
quickly.
