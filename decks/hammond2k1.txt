Deck Name: The Eurobrujah know what you did last summer...

Description: Long range cel / pot workout with Thoughts Betrayed
stopping any nastiness...

Sucks against damage prevention, and dies vs Drawing out the Beast. It
also has limited blood gen - but once you have 2 vampires up, you are
usually safe. Other than that, it has great card flow, superb handling
and really does the business. Not a great deck, or original, but my
best effort in the last few months.

Notes:

1) Trioles Revenge is in there just because I have been against a lot
of Ventrue decks lately. I did have Graverobbing in there, which I
will probably revert to at some stage.

2) The 44s are key permenants in the endame - as borne out earlier.

3) NO HUNTING GROUND! You don't need it - steal the ineveitable Rack.
Interesting that I hunted only once with one vampire all day!

4) Best card for flow... ever - Infernal Pursuit (sup)! Can be played
any time in combat and really clears a hand jam.

5) Only 2 rares in the deck! You don't need a horde of pricey rares to
win.
