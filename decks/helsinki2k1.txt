Crusade: Helsinki

Crypt worked well, I don't think I'd change anything. Corine was one of the mainstays, the +1 strength is really useful.

Masters were ok as well. Heidelburg was not as useful as I'd thought
it would be, but I rarely got it out before endgame. Pb: Montreal gave
me 15+ pool in final (played it on first turn, it was successfully
fetched only once by other players and I got it back immediately).

Meat Hooks were not as useful as I'd imagined; quite a bit of
IGs/maneuvers/S:CEs/dodges in the games. Perhaps replace one
with another Femur (never saw the one in time to equip with it)
and the other with Aid from Bats or something... Sixth intercept
retainer would be nice (in place of Crows), but I don't have it.

Quite nice, except that I once fed my only source of permanent
intercept to one and missed it quite a bit. Also opposing decks
unfairly did not stay still to be hit; some more Traps would
have been useful.

Discarded Malleable Visage all the times I drew it, so it might
be a candidate for replacement. Changelings were useful every
time I drew them.

Reactions worked well. No serious hand jams and even cross-table
vote decks did listen to my comments on acceptable voting
parameters.:-) Comment from prey: "Just _how_ much of that deck
is reaction cards?"

Middling to good. Inner Essences and BoA could perhaps be replaced
with something more useful; some presses would be nice. Got a less-than-
nice lesson on that by 1st round prey, who played a Tremere second
round combat deck...
