I was often content with not taking any actions and letting the master
cards and my wall of intercept do the work. The reaction cards are there to
protect the master cards that are already in play. Aggravated damage (with
or with out Rotschreck) made vamps pay for trying to mess with my stuff.
Multiple master phases were required because I ran through minion cards
quickly and would occasionally see a very gray hand.
