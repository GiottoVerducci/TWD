Deck Name: "OK, What the Hell, a Ventrue Vote Deck"

By: Eric Nawrotzki

This Ventrue Vote Deck shares a fair degree of similarity
to my Toreador vote deck, which won "Praxis Seizure: New Jersey".
Once again defense was a prime consideration. It has Domain Challenges,
Forced Awakenings, and Sudden Reversals to slow down the weenie tap decks
(which for some strange reason there were none). The Archon Investigations
and Protected Resources and the Deflections to deal with the big bleeders
(of which there were many). Since there are more Ventrue Princes the
Toreadors, I went with more 5th Traditions and Minion Taps. The weakest
part is still probably combat defense, but I was able to add Obedience
to the Elysium and Majestys (and I did not encounter any combat rush decks).
