Gangrel Wall of Untap

Josh's deck is a fiendishly clever block and untap
monstrosity. Cats Guidance, Raven Spies, Forced Awakenings,
and Atonement make for constant blocks, and Earth Meld
keeps your people alive and ready for more. Smiling Jack the
Anarch takes down entire tables while pool management
keeps his damage to you to a minimum. Millicent Smith,
Puritan Vampire Hunter is also a really nice addition to this
blocking machine.
(I didn't get Josh's comments on the final, or on his
deck, so I hope he'll respond to this mail with any words of
wisdom on playing this thing.)
