Robert Goudie's Weenie Obfuscate/Auspex deck

Well, first of all, I'm suprised at the contents now that I look at
it. The original version was more heavily weighted toward Night Moves.
This is probably half as many as were in the first version. I also
removed all of the dodges and instead put more intercept. I've always
called it a night moves deck but that really doesn't describe it well
anymore. Let's call it a Weenie Obfuscate/Auspex deck.

The crypt design is pretty obvious. I put 2 of each vampire that had
auspex+obfuscate. I also put 2 of the 1 or 2 capacity vamps with
obfuscate. The auspex vamps are key. I need to get at least one to
start with.

I think I'm pretty well known for really focussed decks (weenie dom bleed,
weenie cryptic mission, weenie undead persistance, etc.) and this is
somewhat of a departure. They're still weenies but I put in a good
number of cards that may or may not be useful. As it turned out, these
additions that watered-down my stealth bleed were a big benefit to me.

I believe I won with no library cards left so I had an opportunity to
play all of the one-shot cards. Delaying Tactics was used to save my bacon.
The Malkavian Dementias were quite nasty and allowed me to take Lucian
from my predator at a couple of key moments. The Muddled was quite useful,
as were the Haven Uncovered (I believe Paul made use of it to attack
Jeff) and the Sudden Reversals.

I essentially used my size to get a quick kill of my first prey. Then,
I had enough intercept to keep my next prey and my predator from killing
me. The neverending supply of stealthy bleeds eventually did the trick.
