Here it is, along with his notes for improvements

Notes: Should replace Greger with another copy of Mariel. His lack of
superior DOM is too much - even though he has a title and OBF. Mariel's
ability is useful when faced with an intercept-combat deck.

Notes: I'd Drop the Takeovers. They weren't effective in this deck.
Replace with an Obfuscate skill card and another Cloak the Gathering.
