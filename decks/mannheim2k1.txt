Bloodsiege: Mannheim
Mannheim, Germany
March 11th 2001
Christoph Hardebusch

The deck won the 'Blood-Siege Mannheim' on the 11.03.2001. There were about
20 participants from all over germany. Unfortunately, the VteS-Coordinator
made some mistake with the renting of the room, so we had to leave too early
to do 3 preliminary rounds, which forced us to go for 2 instead. I am not
quite sure, but I think the tournament results did not go into the ranking
because of that. Which is quite bad, because the deck won the first table,
only one other deck got a victory point. It swept the second table and went
into the final with 9 victory points from 2 games. The final hang on a
thread for a round or two, but then the game went my way and my deck swept
that table, too.

Carpe Jugulum.
