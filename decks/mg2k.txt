Deck Name: Sandwich of the month

Matthew Green won, with a quite EXTRAORDINARY toolbox Malky deck,
including [blush, simper] Out-of-turn Rush/aggravated damage/Rötschreck
combat. He only had 5.5VP to get to the final but he engineered this
quite BRILLIANTLY, ensuring, for example, in the third heat that none of
the other players was going to get more VP than him, and that the biggest
threats to him were stymied. He then played a total blinder in the final,
starting off slow, blocking or voting down [with my help] Rob's votes,
helping me to bring Rob down to 1 pool and then using a Madness Network
Dramatic Upheaval to swap places with me, so that he could bleed out Rob
and then, via a Deflection, me. A really AMAZING performance and one for
the aficionados. Well done, Matt! All the finalists got AH boosters -
thanks, John!

Here's matthew's winning deck, with his comments.

"The deck could stand some improvement, it was the first time it had
seen competitive play. The Bum's Rushes were pretty bad, another hunter
would have been better. The Legendary Vampire was great as were the
My E's-E's. Telepathic Vote Counting should be something different and
the deck should have Sudden Reversals and maybe a DI. Tribute to the
Master effectively kept Rob T in the game during round 1, I had no way
to deal with it. Masters in this deck are at a premium really and adding
still more OOT cards may be a bad idea. I'll try it and see."
