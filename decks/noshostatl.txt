Deck Name: Nocturns turn the Cog

Appius Claudius Corvus loves to reveal his Enkil Cog to the world.
There are plenty of Nocturns to ensure that some bleeds of one get
thru before the lunge.
This deck took 1.5VP in the first round, swept up 5VP in the
second round, and squeaked in 3VP in final for the tournament win.
