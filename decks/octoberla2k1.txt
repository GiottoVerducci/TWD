Scourge of El Segundo

"The Waiting"

This is the first time I've ever run this deck or anything like it. I
attempted to build a deck that could survive long enough in a tournament
environment in order to make a deal or two and then finish off my prey
and maybe my grand prey in one huge flurry. Based on my
previous tournament experience I figured I'd face alot of bleed and vote
and not much rush/combat that didn't feature IG (in which case
I'd be screwed anyway), hence the lack of combat cards. The idea is to
generate enough blood to keep your pool away from any huge
votes or bleeds, sudden or DI anything that's gonna hurt you real bad,
try not to piss off the D-attackers, let your predator bleed your
prey and wait for the moment to strike.

The crypt features 7 votes and plenty of dominate for those
deflections. Plus with 42 master cards out of 90 total, Anson is a MUST.
Ulugh and Cardano are the Day Op finishers and Muaziz is versatility.
You must be VERY patient playing this deck, you can't really go
forward until you're ready to commit everything for the kill. I tried
to rifle through the deck as quickly as possible (Storage
Annex/Ulugh/Parthenon) and get the cards I need for the finisher locked
in the annexes. All you're looking for is to get your prey down
to 7 pool, then send Muaziz in to knock out any stoppers with a
Revelations and then go for it! Ultimately this is proof that a deck
doesn't have to be some kind of "nasty creature" to win a tourney.
