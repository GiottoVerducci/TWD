Peter Bakija's Praxis Seizure: Buffalo 99 winning deck

"The Nosferatu Hate You", Mk. IV

This deck is highly proactive--its bleed defense is killing the vampires who
want to bleed it, its vote defense is killing the vampires who want to call
votes against it, and its combat defense is to kill, kill, kill. It rarely,
if ever, blocks anything, and as such, is almost always completely tapped
out, having had all of its vampires attacked on its turn. It'll have a lot of
trouble with a persistent Gangrel deck, a serious manuver deck, or some sort
of deck that has a lot of Fortitude and Presses, but these are pretty
uncommon in a tournament environment.
