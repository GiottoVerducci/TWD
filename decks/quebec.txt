Here's the results of the first canadian
DCI-sanctionned-VTES-constructed-deck Tournament

It was a hard fight for Pierre-Hugues, who has won his place for the final only
in the 3rd round. With the efforts he made in dealing with others for votes, we
can say that he surely deserves his title of Primogen Ventrue !
