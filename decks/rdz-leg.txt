Legbiter's winning deck. Basically this is a clone of the "Princes of
Carthage" deck that got R David Zopf to the DragonCon finals. David's modest
claim that this was "just thrown together" is somewhat undermined by the fact
that the deck can still do well in the hands of a different player on the
other side of the pond! However, I admit I have tweaked the deck a little
[more KRCs, kept the Kine Dominances, didn't increase the Carthages, changed
a few of the masters]. In play it flows beautifully. The only change i might
make to it now is maybe to put in a few alacritys - perhaps replacing the
Sengir dagger, one of the closed sessions and one of the Bewitching orations.
This is because the only time the deck struggled was when Garry, with a
decent amount of intercept, good combat and a few votes of his own, was my
predator. Interestingly, this deck didn't do THAT well when we playtested it
in my group last monday - i got 2VP but also got kippered by Drummer John's
fast presence-bleed deck. Admittedly that was in part because i made a
FOOLISH error, but still .... guess the playgroup ain't the same thing as the
tournament, eh?
