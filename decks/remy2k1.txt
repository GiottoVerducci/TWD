Deck Name: Shadowrun

The strength of the deck is the Spying Mission, even if it does only 3
with 2 actions. Temptation were very useful and so was the Enticement.
I used Enticement 2 times to oust my preys who thought that I was only
going to bleed them for 1. I was lucky not to meet too many combat
decks but I manage to oust my prey even with 2 Gangrel decks against
me at the table. I played my first succesful Dismemberment of Osiris
on Ambrosio Luis Moncada, it's a very strong card (to put in every
Setite deck). Maybe more Marked Path and less MotF. The "reduce
bleed" side of the deck was "very" useful ; with Lalitha and Julius.
