A beautiful deck to watch in operation.
He wants a cool name for it, but at 7 o' clock
in the morning, the best we could come up with was the Lazverinus All
Skills All Stars deck. Better name suggestions on a postcard please.
The deck doesn't look much but what has to be taken into account is the
calibre of the player, who knows exactly when to play and when not to,
and ensures a good cycle of his cards to get exactly what he needs, when
he needs it. Apologies if any cards are mentioned more than once, total
the number of them if it happens.
