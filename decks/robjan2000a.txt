offensive as the hostiles and parity shifts work well together. Crypt is a
bit odd, could do with one or two mid-pointers with obfuscate but in the end
better off going for good old Sir Walt. Would not have done so well if not
for the total lack of combat at the last tournament. Went for more obfuscate
which worked well due to the usual and amazing lack of intercept at Portsmouth.
