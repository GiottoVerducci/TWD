Here's the deck that Rob Treasure won the November Portsmouth
Tournament with, together with his comments, both on the deck
and the tournament.

Rob's Ventrue Untouchables

"I wanted to try to show that my old faves can still rock
and roll in a tournament arena. The deck harps back to the
Ventrue Steamroller deck of GenCon97 with revisions for the
7/7 rulings which DID NOT help the Ventrue [Pulled Fangs,
Fame/Day Op, Tomb etc etc] needed to be done however.

It fits in most of the "Classic Cards" as well as a slice
of obfuscate in place of the multitude of Day Ops. The
value of Master phases/cards are realised as they are laid
down 2 at a time - no one can deny the effectiveness of a
double Hostile in the right hands. Might take out the
revelations, they are useful to get rid of intercept,
wakes or power cards but more Daring the Dawn or Hostiles
would be more useful. I like the crypt, obviously powervamp
Arika and Queen Anne are the mainstay but either of the
other princes with an obf skill card can kick ass. Lady
Luck can boot you in the nuts with your draw of four but
as long as one of the biggies come out you are ok.

The deck has very little intercept. I tend to save the
2nd Trads and the Rumor Mill for emergencies and rely on
Hostiles, Banishments, Deflections and agitation as
"offensive defense". It has a lot of powerful one-shot
plays, biding your time, slotting together a good hand
and playing it well can take out two or cripple three
players in a turn. The deck is all about laying low and
balancing tables then pouncing when you are very sure
or taking a calculated risk [my kind of deck].

I was impressed with [and scared by!] a couple of decks
at the tourney. Niki's Trap/Undead Persistence deck was
cool, I liked the obvious but overlooked inclusion of
superior Dom. Will's horrible allies blender deck is
great, the hurt comes from an unexpected source and the
sheer numbers are hard to handle. 19 players. Could be
wrong but no Malk. S&B decks, F* ***** Hooray."

He's not wrong about the lack of cheese. Only one tap
and bleed deck, too! It was also good to see Nathan's
!Tre combat deck and Garry's big blokes doing well.
