Deck Name: " I'll be your dog"
Created by: Rob Treasure

Description: Block and slaughter, fixed bleed, lots of nasty surprises
Does not like S:CE but can block regularly enough to give it huge
problems. An interesting and fun deck to play have to take a few risks,
too easy to sit tight and remain reactive.
