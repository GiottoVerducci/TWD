Deck Name: ' I'll be your dog !'

Description: Block and slaughter, fixed bleed, lots of nasty surprises.
Does not like S:CE but can block regularly enough to give it huge
problems. An interesting and fun deck to play - have to take a few
risks, too easy to sit tight and remain reactive. Meshenka is my
firm favourite, backed up by a stack of other great vamps (Dragos,
Lambach, weenie bleed/blockers and of course Devin Bisley and her
PMT charged big sister Corine.)
