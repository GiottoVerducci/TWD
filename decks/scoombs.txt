Description: Well there it is...
Some comments about playing this deck:
1. Don't rely on getting any specific card, nor wait for one.
2. Play the hand you receive (all surprises from the deck will be good, I promise)
3. Cycle -- Focus on going forward, you cannot win with this deck if you turtle up.
4. This deck was designed to play at a 4 player table... (It's what I'm used to and usually what I see in tournaments)
5. Yes this deck is not perfect and it does have weaknesses, but I foresee changes to it in the not too distant future.
6. I'd like to thank David and Jose and the Charlotte play group for all their help and teachings over the last year.
