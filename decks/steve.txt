Steve Wright is thus not only the tallest Jyhad player in England but the
champion of Portsmouth, at least until our next run-in which will probably
occur in about 6 weeks' time [date uncertain because we want to avoid
clashing with world cup matches]. Well done Steve! Not bad for someone who
got Nul Points in Praxis Seizure: Isle of Wight! Here is his winning deck:

Interestingly, Steve's deck is almost a 4CL affair .... and clearly could
be made 4CL by the simple expedient of replacing one of the WWEFs with
another Second Tradition. It worked essentially because whenever people
tried things against it Steve had a counter. Example: I tried a
cross-table Bum's rush. He Direct-Intervention'd it.
