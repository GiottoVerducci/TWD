The Laptops, AI, Sudden and Rumor Mill were late additions to the
deck, the AI and Sudden mainly from my last meeting with Barney. The
Rumor Mill was the most valuable though. It made several bleeders
think twice over the day as well as giving me something nice to offer
other people apart from heads being kicked in.
