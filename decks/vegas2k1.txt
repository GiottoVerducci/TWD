Bird Man of Alcatraz

Caleb said his goal is simple. Get 7 Raptors and Eternal Vigilance on Lambach,
and then grind everything into the dirt. Blood recursion keeps him and Lambach
alive while Smiling Jack wrecks house. It helped that the final was untimed.
It lasted 3 hours 15 minutes (yeesh!). Caleb said he would improve the
deck by adding another Lambach (in place of Anson) and some Eagle Sights.
