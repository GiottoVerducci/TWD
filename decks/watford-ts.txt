Tournament
Watford, England
July 28th 2001
Tony Smith

Deck: Notaweeniedominatedeck version III

The idea is to hit the ground running. Either use
superior govern to pull out your vamps for 1 pool, and
assault once a huge force is amassed. Or bleed like
shit off a shovel from the first turn. Either way it
often takes out multiply preys in a turn. If it's
running well, and your prey has no deflections, it
should clean then out in about 4 turns.
Little combat defense but letting a few die to get
through with the one 6 point bleed is often the way to
go
Cheesy as hell, but funny as fuck.

Ivory Bow (didn't see it all day, may need to come
out)

The 2 vamps in the crypt with superior dominate were a
last minute thing. They can't use the governs at
superior, but the inclusion allowed me to cut the
number of dom masters and makes it run a little
quicker if they are in the opening crypt. I found that
by using 4 caps as opposed to the normal dom weenies,
I got all the benefits of a weenie deck, but with a
few less disadvantages.
