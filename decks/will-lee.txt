William Lee transcribed his Tzimisce deck for me. Here it is, the
intercept-combat deck that won the last but one Portsmouth tournament
[in April]:

That's a direct copy of what Will wrote out for me, and I reproduce it
in part because I think it gives an insight into his creative process.
And Will is VERY creative, AND a nice guy, AND a good player. Moreover,
he has the loudest voice of ANY Jyhad player I have ever met, a fact
which becomes apparent to the entire block once he starts losing.

Notice that this deck, constructed for an NCL environment, is also valid
for 6CL. It also contains rather few rares, and would probably function
quite well without those. Hey, i'm getting the hang of this subtle hints
business, doncha think? Hope you are listening, CL dudes and dudettes.
